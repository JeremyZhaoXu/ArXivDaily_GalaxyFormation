 - **Abstract**
 We present detailed radio observations of the mid-infrared (MIR) tidal disruption event (TDE) WTP14adeqka. We detect rising radio emission starting $\approx 4$ years after the discovery of the MIR emission (and about 2 years after its peak), peaking at $\approx 6.5$ years and declining thereafter, reminiscent of the delayed radio emission recently identified in optically discovered TDEs. The peak radio luminosity, $\nu L_\nu\approx 2\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, is comparable to the brightest radio emission in optical TDEs. Multi-frequency radio observations at 8.9 and 9.7 years reveal a non-relativistic outflow with a mean expansion velocity of $\approx 0.021c$ (for an assumed launch at the time of disruption) and an energy of $\approx 10^{50.7}$ erg, about an order of magnitude larger than in typical optical TDEs. More importantly, Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at the same epochs directly resolve the radio source and reveal an increase in size from approximately 0.11 pc to 0.13 pc (with no apparent astrometric shift), corresponding to an expansion velocity of $\approx 0.05c$, and a likely delayed launch by about 2 years. The VLBA size measurements rule out an off-axis jet launched at the time of disruption, which would have an expected size of $\gtrsim {\rm pc}$ on these timescales; the possibility of a delayed jet can be evaluated with future VLBA observations. We conclude that MIR TDEs can launch energetic, delayed outflows. Ongoing radio observations of the full MIR TDE sample will reveal whether this behavior is ubiquitous.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations reveal a striking diversity in dwarf galaxy structures, spanning a wide range of masses, inner density slopes, shapes, and sizes. Tidal stripping may play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of these galaxies, yet the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using idealized N-body simulations, we investigate the tidal evolution of two-component systems -- stellar and dark matter -- embedded in a host potential. We find that in terms of energy distributions, both stellar and dark matter particles are stripped identically, regardless of their initial profiles. This surprising result suggests that the energy distribution of stripped stars can provide direct constraints on the underlying dark matter structure. Furthermore, we show that systems with cored dark matter and cuspy stellar profiles naturally evolve into dark matter-deficient (DMD) galaxies, supporting tidal stripping as a viable DMD formation pathway. This energy-space analysis of multi-component systems offers new insights into the dynamical evolution of tidally stripped galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows are a key part of the galactic gas cycle and crucial in shaping the star formation activity in their host galaxy. Yet, in simulations of galaxy evolution, modeling these outflows in their multi-phase nature and over the relevant timescales is an unsolved problem. We present a subgrid model for simulating multiphase galactic outflows in efficient, comparatively low-resolution simulations, designed for application in future cosmological simulations. The cold phase (T = 10000 K) is treated as pressureless, and its interaction with the hot phase is captured through source terms representing drag and mixing. These terms are obtained using analytic drag and mixing terms for single clouds and convolving them with a cloud mass distribution consistent with high-resolution simulations. Applied to a setup resembling the starburst galaxy M82, the model reproduces the velocity, density, and mass outflow rates of high-resolution simulations that resolve individual cold clouds. Cold outflows emerge naturally from interactions between the hot wind and cold interstellar clouds, with drag and mixing both contributing to the acceleration. Varying the mixing strength strongly affects outflow properties: stronger mixing enhances mass transfer from hot to cold gas, reduces the hot phase velocity, and accelerates the cold phase, while also influencing the origin and composition of the cold outflow. Weak mixing produces cold gas mostly from preexisting interstellar clouds, whereas stronger mixing leads to substantial cold gas formation from the hot phase. This framework enables efficient simulations of multiphase galactic outflows while retaining key multi-component features of the outflow dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Generative models are a promising tool to produce cosmological simulations but face significant challenges in scalability, physical consistency, and adherence to domain symmetries, limiting their utility as alternatives to $N$-body simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000 halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational clustering of structure formation, moving closer to physically realistic and efficient simulators for the evolution of large-scale structures in the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the impact of non-power-law spectra of matter perturbations with a bump or with a blue tilt at small scales on the evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located the innermost part of galaxies. We study SMBH's mass growth rate and the epochs of their birth in four cosmological models using N-body simulations of dark matter within the box of $(100$~Mpc$/h)^3$. The simulations were populated with SMBHs using TRINITY semi-analytic model. We found that the most massive SMBHs at the redshifts $z=5-6$ are similar in all considered cosmologies, including the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. At larger $z$ the bumpy spectra can provide a tenfold increase (relative to $\Lambda$CDM model) in the masses of individual black holes without requiring super-Eddington accretion or heavy seeds. The nucleation of SMBHs starts at $z\sim 13$, which is earlier than in the standard $\Lambda$CMD model.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter halos are fundamental cosmological structures whose properties-such as concentration, ellipticity, and mass centroid-encode information about their formation and evolution. Concentration traces collapse time and internal structure, while ellipticity and centroid offsets reflect halo shape and dynamical state. Accurate characterization of these properties improves mass estimates and tests dark matter models. Gravitational lensing, which directly probes projected mass distributions, provides a powerful means to constrain halo structure. We present a 2D weak-lensing analysis of 299 RedMaPPer clusters using shear measurements from the HSC-SSP first-year data release. By fitting elliptical NFW models with mass priors from the RedMaPPer cluster richness-mass relation, considering the priors helps us break the mass-concentration degeneracy and tighten constraints on other parameters. The derived concentration-mass relation exhibits a slightly steeper slope than traditional weak-lensing power-law or upturn models, and agrees more closely with the results from strong lensing selected halos. More massive and lower-redshift clusters tend to have lower concentrations and appear more spherical. The halo ellipticity distribution is characterized by e=1-b/a=0.530+/-0.168, with a mean of <e>=0.505+/-0.007. We also detect a bimodal distribution in the offsets between optical centers and mass centroids: some halos are well-aligned with their brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), while others show significant displacements. These results highlight the power of 2D weak-lensing modeling in probing halo morphology and in providing key inputs for understanding and modeling systematic effects in stacked lensing analyses.
#### Gravitational Instability and Fragmentation in Collapsar Disks Supports the Formation of Sub-Solar Neutron Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We perform three-dimensional shearing-box hydrodynamical simulations to explore the outcome of gravitational instability in the outer regions of neutrino-cooled disks such as those formed from the collapse of rotating massive stars ("collapsars''). We employ a physical equation of state, optically-thin neutrino cooling, and assume an electron fraction set by the balance of electron/positron pair-capture reactions. Disks in a marginally stable initial state (Toomre parameter Q~ 1) undergo runaway cooling and fragmentation when the dimensionless cooling timescale obeys tau_cool = t_cool*Omega < 10, where Omega is the orbital frequency; these conditions correspond to accretion rates > Msun/s on the upper end of those achieved by collapsar progenitor stars. Fragmentation leads to the formation of neutron-rich clumps (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.1) spanning a range of masses ~0.01-1 Msun around the local Jeans value. Most clumps exceed the local Chandrasekhar mass M_Ch ~ Ye^2 and hence will continue to collapse to nuclear densities, forming neutron stars (NS) with sub-solar masses otherwise challenging to create through ordinary stellar core-collapse. Even cool disks dominated by alpha-particles (Ye ~ 0.5) can fragment and collapse into neutron-rich clumps capable of forming sub-solar NSs. Although our simulations cannot follow this process directly, if the disk-formed NSs subsequently pair into binaries, the gravitational wave chirps from their rapid mergers are potentially detectable by ground based observatories. The temporal coincidence of such a hierarchical NS merger chain with the collapsar gamma-ray burst and supernova would offer a uniquely spectacular multi-messenger "symphony''.
#### A Jetted Wandering Massive Black Hole Candidate in a Dwarf Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Wandering massive black holes (MBHs) are thought to form through gravitational recoil or galaxy mergers, but observational confirmation of their displacement in dwarf galaxies, critical laboratories for early-universe SMBH seeding, remains scarce. Using multi-epoch very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), we identify a displaced MBH in the dwarf galaxy MaNGA 12772-12704, located 0.94 kilo-parsec from its optical center. The source exhibits unambiguous signatures of an accreting MBH: a brightness temperature exceeding $10^9$K, a parsec-scale jet, and flux density variability over a 30-year baseline. This system provides the first robust evidence that dynamical black hole interactions predicted in hierarchical galaxy evolution occur even in low-mass hosts. The discovery challenges models requiring centralized gas reservoirs for MBH growth and directly informs high-redshift seeding scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The classic model of the Local Group (LG) is that of two dominant constituents, the Milky Way and M31, first separating and then detaching from the Hubble flow, leading to a nearly radial approaching orbit. This simple model has been confronted by new measurements of the 3D M31 kinematics, by cosmological simulations, and by theoretical understanding of the impact of massive substructures such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. This article explores the consequences of new observations and theory on the determination of the mass and dynamics of the LG. The M31 tangential velocity measurement and contribution from the cosmological constant both increase the implied timing mass of the LG to be $\sim 5 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. Timing mass estimates for the LG tend to be larger than the sum of the Milky Way and M31 halo masses, and larger than independent LG mass estimators. Precision future kinematics have the potential to explore the origin of this difference, shed light on dark matter in the LG, the origin of its angular momentum, and possibly even local values of cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We use Magellan/MIKE echelle spectroscopy to conduct an in-depth chemodynamical analysis of the most luminous star-forming region within the metal-poor starburst dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. Leveraging the exceptional high resolution (R$\sim$50,000) and broad wavelength coverage, we apply Bayesian inference to simultaneously model the fluxes of 30 emission lines spanning the wavelength range 3400-9200Å. Employing a two-region ionisation model, we characterise various gas properties including electron temperature, electron density, and chemical abundances across different elements. Our direct-method inferred metallicity yields $\rm 12+\log(O/H)=7.77\pm0.03$, placing the galaxy in the metal-poor regime. Furthermore, Metal-to-Oxygen ratios such as log(S/O), log(Ne/O) or log(Ar/O) are in full agreement with the values derived for the Milky Way, consistent with expectations from stellar evolutionary models. The brightest emission lines are kinematically complex, with modelling requiring up to four distinct components. The exceptional resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the data unveil asymmetric and wide ($\sigma_{HeII} \approx$ 35km/s) HeII$\lambda$4686 emission. The flux ratio of this nebular line, together with the absence of other high ionisation species such as [NeV]$\lambda$3426, indicates the presence of fast radiative shocks. This dataset underscores the capability of echelle spectroscopy in delivering comprehensive chemodynamical analyses of starbursts in the Local Volume.
