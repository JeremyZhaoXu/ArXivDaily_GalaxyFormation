 - **Abstract**
 FAST observations have recently identified a compact HI cloud (hereafter Cloud-9) in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy M94. This identification has been confirmed independently by VLA and GBT observations. Cloud-9 has the same recession velocity as M94, and is therefore at a similar distance ($\sim$4.4 Mpc). It is compact ($\sim$1$'$ radius, or $\sim$1.4 kpc), dynamically cold ($W_{50}=12$ km/s), non-rotating, and fairly massive, with an HI mass of $\sim 10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$. Here we present deep HST/ACS imaging designed to search for a luminous stellar counterpart. We visually rule out the presence of any dwarf galaxy with stellar mass exceeding 10$^{3.5}$$M_{\odot}$. A more robust color-magnitude diagram-based analysis rules out a 10$^{4}$$M_{\odot}$ stellar counterpart with 99.5$\%$ confidence. The non-detection of a luminous component reinforces the interpretation that this system is a Reionization-Limited HI Cloud (RELHIC); i.e., a starless dark matter halo filled with hydrostatic gas in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. Our results make Cloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate of any known compact HI cloud. This provides strong support for a cornerstone prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model, namely the existence of gas-filled starless dark matter halos on sub-galactic mass scales, and constrains the present-day threshold halo mass for galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) represents a compelling alternative to collisionless dark matter, with diverse phenomenological signals from dwarf galaxy to galaxy cluster scales. We present new constraints on the SIDM cross section from the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155, host to the strongly lensed supernovae Requiem and Encore. Our analysis combines strong gravitational lensing with spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the central galaxy, employing several methodological advances over previous cluster-scale SIDM studies. The result is a self-consistent measurement of the density profile of MACS J0138-2155 across two orders of magnitude in radius. Our lensing and kinematics analyses individually yield highly consistent results, and from their combination we report a 95% confidence upper limit on the SIDM cross section of $\sigma/m < 0.613$ cm$^2$/g, at an interaction velocity of $\langle v_\text{pair}\rangle < 2090$ km/s. This constraint, derived from the most detailed single-system analysis to date, is competitive with previous cluster-scale limits while demonstrating the power of combining complementary gravitational probes. The methodology developed here advances precision cluster lens modeling and will inform future studies of dark matter physics, as well as time-delay cosmography in this unique strong lensing system. Additionally, our results imply SN Requiem will reappear sooner than previously reported, with a 1$\sigma$ CL between January 2027 and November 2028 at H$_0 = 67.7$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe mHz gravitational waves from a wide variety of astrophysical sources. Of these, some will be characterizable as individual deterministic signals; the remainder will overlap to create astrophysical confusion noise. These sources of confusion noise are known as stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). LISA data is expected to include several such astrophysical SGWBs, including the notable Galactic binary foreground, SGWBs from white dwarf binary populations in satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and the SGWB from extragalactic stellar-origin binary black holes far from merger. To characterize these astrophysical signals and attempt to seek out possible underlying backgrounds of cosmological origin, it will be necessary to separate the contribution of each SGWB from that of the others. Crucially, several of these SGWBs are expected to be highly anisotropic on the sky, providing a powerful tool for spectral separation. To this end, we present BLIP 2.0: a flexible, GPU-accelerated framework for simulation and Bayesian analysis of arbitrary combinations of isotropic and anisotropic SGWBs. We leverage these capabilities to demonstrate for the first time spectral separation of the Galactic foreground, the Large Magellanic Cloud SGWB, and the SGWB from extragalactic stellar-origin binaries, and show a proof-of-concept for placing upper limits on the detection of an underlying isotropic cosmological SGWB in the presence of multiple astrophysical foregrounds.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances in young G-, K-, and M-type stars (temperatures between 6500 and 3100 K) using infrared APOGEE-2 spectra. Atmospheric parameters were determined for 548 young stars in the Orion complex (Orion A, B, OB1, and $\lambda$ Ori) using the TONALLI code. For 340 slow rotators v sini $\leq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), we derived C, Mg, Si, K, Ti, and Fe abundances using 19 atomic lines, MARCS model atmospheres, and BACCHUS. To mitigate the impact of circumstellar material, we excluded stars with infrared excess identified via 2MASS and WISE photometry. We find sub-solar [X/H] abundance ratios, consistent across elements and among all four groups, suggesting a chemically homogeneous Orion complex. We computed [$\alpha$/Fe] from [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], obtaining a median of $-0.14 \pm 0.04$, about 0.10 dex lower than the value for nearby main-sequence stars ($-0.04 \pm 0.04$) at similar [Fe/H]. This result aligns with predictions from Galactic chemical evolution models. Furthermore, the median [C/H] abundance we derived for Orion agrees with previous estimations based on the analysis of the ionized gas of the Orion nebula. This work sets the stage for extending the analysis to stars with circumstellar material and higher rotational velocities, which will not only improve our understanding of Orion, but also provide critical insight into the formation and evolution of young stars, as well as the chemical evolution of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze 4,859 O-stars in the OGLE-III photometric survey of the LMC, including 415 eclipsing binaries (EBs). After accounting for the geometrical probability of eclipses, the period distribution of O-type binaries across $P$ = 2.5-200 days follows a power-law $f_{\rm logP}$ $\propto$ (logP)$^{\Pi}$ with $\Pi$ = $-$0.34$\pm$0.06, which is skewed toward shorter periods compared to Opik's law ($\Pi$ = 0). We divide our O-stars into seven environments based on their clustering with B-stars and other O-stars. The EB fraction of O-stars in young clusters is 10.2%$\pm$0.6%, which matches the 10.8%$\pm$2.1% for O-stars in young Milky Way clusters. O-stars in old clusters exhibit a lower EB fraction of 5.5%$\pm$0.9% due to the effects of binary evolution. O-stars in young dense clusters, young sparse associations, and even low-mass clusters that formed in situ in the field have similar EB fractions. This uniformity suggests that the formation of close massive binaries depends on small-scale gas physics, e.g., fragmentation and migration within protostellar disks, whereas N-body interactions that scale with cluster density do not affect the close binary properties of massive stars that remain in clusters. Conversely, ejected O-stars in the field exhibit a lower close binary fraction. The EB fractions of field walkaways (projected velocities $v_{\rm proj}$ $<$ 24.5 km s$^{-1}$) and field runaways ($v_{\rm proj}$ $>$ 24.5 km s$^{-1}$) are 7.3%$\pm$1.0% and 4.7%$\pm$1.0%, respectively. These values suggest that most field O-stars were dynamically ejected via N-body interactions from their birth clusters, whereas field O-stars that formed in situ or were kicked from supernova explosions in binaries contribute 17% and $<$28%, respectively, to the field population.

 - **Abstract**
 SPHEREx is a NASA infrared astronomy mission that launched on March 12th, 2025 and is operating successfully in low-Earth orbit (LEO). The mission is currently observing the entire sky in 102 spectral channels in four independent all-sky surveys and also achieves enhanced coverage in two deep fields. This data will resolve key science questions about the early universe, galaxy formation, and the origin of water and biogenic molecules. In this paper, we describe the survey planning software (SPS) that enables SPHEREx to observe efficiently while mitigating a range of operational challenges in LEO. Our optimal target selection algorithm achieves the required high coverage in both the All-Sky and Deep Surveys. The algorithm plans observations to stay within our time-varying allowable pointing zone, interleaves required data downlink passes, and mitigates outages due to the South Atlantic Anomaly and other events. As demonstrated by the sky coverage achieved in the first SPHEREx public data release, our approach is performing well in flight. The SPHEREx SPS is a key new capability that enables the mission to deliver groundbreaking science from LEO.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we propose an energy decomposition method to improve the numerical stability of time-evolving magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) coronal models, enabling them to resolve the stronger magnetic field during solar maxima without significantly filtering out small-scale structures from the observed this http URL advance the decomposed energy that excludes the magnetic energy, instead of the total energy, in time. It avoids the operation of subtracting a large magnetic energy from the total energy to obtain a very small thermal pressure in low-beta regions, thereby improving the numerical stability of MHD models. We implemented this method in COCONUT and validated the model by performing a time-evolving coronal simulation during Carrington Rotation (CR) 2296, a solar maximum CR. We also compare quasi-steady-state simulation results during the solar minimum and the increasing phase, calculated using both versions of COCONUT adopting the decomposed energy equation and the traditional full energy equation to further validate the reliability of the energy decomposition method. The simulation results show that the energy decomposition method yields results nearly identical to those of the traditional full energy equation during solar minimum, while significantly enhancing COCONUT's ability to simulate coronal evolution under strong magnetic fields, even those exceeding 100 Gauss. This method is well suited for performing quasi-realistic time-evolving coronal simulations around solar maxima without excessively filtering out the observed strong magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the quenching mechanisms in dwarf galaxies is crucial for constraining models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this vein, isolated dwarf galaxies offer valuable insight by helping disentangle the relative roles of internal and environmental processes in shutting down star formation. Here we report the discovery of a quiescent early-type dwarf galaxy (dE), SDSS J011754.86+095819.0 (hereafter dE01+09), located in a nearly isolated environment at a projected distance of approximately one megaparsec from its most likely host group, the NGC 524 group. dE01+09 has M_r = -15.72 and g-r = 0.67 mag and its light profile is well described by a Sérsic function with an index n = 1.1, consistent with typical dEs. Using optical spectroscopy from the DESI survey, we derive its simple stellar population properties, finding an intermediate luminosity-weighted age of 8.3$\pm$1.4 Gyr and a subsolar metallicity of -1.19$\pm$0.21 dex -- characteristics comparable to those of classical quiescent dEs. We propose that NGC 524 may represent an extreme example of group dynamics, in which a member galaxy, dE01+09, is ejected from its host group and subsequently evolves as an isolated system in the field.
#### Galaxy Group Spin Alignment with Cosmic Filament in the TNG Simulation

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the alignment between the spin vectors of galaxy groups and the axes of their nearest cosmic filaments using the TNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. By systematically analyzing a large sample of groups, we find a robust perpendicular alignment between group spin and filament orientation. Among all examined properties, only group mass and the distance to the nearest filament significantly affect the strength of this alignment: more massive groups and those closer to filaments exhibit a stronger perpendicular signal. In contrast, the alignment is largely insensitive to group richness, the stellar mass threshold used to select member galaxies, and redshift. We further quantify the bias introduced by using member galaxies as tracers of group spin, finding a typical misalignment angle of $\sim38^\circ$ between the spin measured from all dark matter particles and that inferred from member galaxies, independent of group richness or stellar mass cut. Our results provide a clear theoretical benchmark for interpreting observational measurements of spin-filament alignment and highlight the importance of considering group mass and environment. These findings help clarify the main factors influencing spin-filament alignment and provide useful context for future observational and theoretical studies of angular momentum in the cosmic web.
#### Forecasting 21-cm power spectrum sensitivity to dark Matter-baryon scattering

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20507

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential of upcoming 21-cm interferometric observations to probe interacting dark matter (IDM). We focus on scenarios where the dark matter-baryon scattering cross-section scales as $\sigma(v) =\sigma_{0} v^n$, with $\sigma_{0}$ being the normalization constant, $v$ the relative velocity between dark matter and baryons, and $n$ characterizing the velocity dependence. Specifically, we emphasize two cases: Coulomb-like interaction ($n = -4$) and velocity-independent interaction ($n = 0$). Using detailed simulations of the 21-cm power spectrum and the Fisher matrix formalism, we forecast the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which targets the frequency range 50-225 MHz, to both IDM and astrophysical parameters. We marginalize over key astrophysical uncertainties, including star formation efficiency, ionizing photon escape fraction, and X-ray luminosity. Our results demonstrate that 21-cm power spectrum measurements can significantly improve sensitivity to IDM cross-section, with at least a factor of five improvement over global signal forecasts for the $n=0$ case, and more than an order of magnitude enhancement for the $n=-4$ scenario. These forecasts also significantly improve upon the existing bounds from cosmic microwave background and Milky Way satellite abundance observations. Our analysis also shows that the IDM cross-section exhibits no correlation with the parameters associated with star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction of Population-II stars. However, we find that the Coulomb-like cross-section is positively correlated with X-ray luminosity. Our results highlight the critical role of accounting for astrophysical uncertainties in obtaining robust inferences of dark matter-baryon interactions from future 21-cm power spectrum observations.
