 - **Abstract**
 The dark matter flux in a direct detection experiment depends on its local speed distribution. This distribution has been inferred from simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, but such models serve only as proxies given that no simulation directly captures the detailed evolution of our own Galaxy. This motivates alternative approaches which obtain this distribution directly from observations. In this work, we utilize 98 Milky Way analogues from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation to develop and validate a procedure for inferring the dark matter speed distribution using the kinematics of nearby stars. We find that the dark matter that originated from old mergers, plus that from recent non-luminous accretions, is well described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution centered at the local standard-of-rest velocity. Meanwhile, recently accreted dark matter from massive mergers has speeds that can be traced from the associated stellar debris of these events. The stellar populations systematically underestimate the velocity dispersion of their dark matter counterparts, but a simple kinematic boost brings the two into good alignment. Using the TNG50 host galaxies, we demonstrate that combining these two contributions provides an accurate reconstruction of the local dark matter speeds. As an application of the procedure to our own Galaxy, we utilize stellar kinematic data from Gaia to quantify how the dark matter remnants from the Milky Way's last major merger impact its speed distribution in the Solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on electromagnetic signatures of accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at milli-parsec separations, using 3D hyper-Lagrangian resolution hydrodynamical simulations. We model binaries embedded in a self-gravitating circumbinary disc that evolves following an adiabatic equation of state, including viscous heating and black-body cooling. Focusing on binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q=1, 0.7$, we find that radiation pressure significantly affects both the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the light curves (LCs). The emission from the mini-discs shifts from the optical towards UV frequencies and with a peak luminosity orders of magnitude higher, while the circumbinary disc becomes colder and dimmer as a result of its geometrically thinner configuration. Temporal variability is affected as well: near UV and soft-X ray fluxes are higher and more variable. Crucially, radiation pressure suppresses the characteristic "lump" formation in equal-mass circular systems, while a lump is formed for higher eccentricities without imprinting any modulation on the flux. In the circular case we still find a modulation on the cavity edge timescale at a frequency $0.36 \, f_{\rm K}$, while in eccentric binaries, only robust orbital period modulations ($f=1,2 \, f_{\rm K}$) are observed, with no modulation associated with the cavity orbital motion. Moreover, the enhanced emission from the mini-discs and streams due to radiation pressure, one redshifted, results in brighter flux in the optical G band, proving detectability of MBHBs signatures even at higher redshift ($z=0.6-1.0$). Our results reveal that radiation pressure plays a crucial role in shaping MBHBs spectral and time-domain features, with implications for their identification in time-domain surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of nine open clusters in the solar neighborhood using kinematic data from Gaia DR 3, aiming to identify potential dynamical signatures of stellar-mass black holes through a comparison of theoretical and observed dispersion profiles. The selected clusters include LP2373 gp4, NGC 1980, NGC 2451A, NGC 2516, NGC 3532, NGC 6475, UBC 7, Praesepe, and Pleiades. We refine the center positions of the clusters with the Meanshift algorithm. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we calculate the velocity dispersion for each cluster and construct one-dimensional velocity dispersion profiles. NGC 2516, NGC 3532, and NGC 6475 show potential central cusps in their radial velocity dispersion profiles, which may indicate the presence of stellar-mass black holes. LP2373 gp4, NGC 6475, and Praesepe all display a negative correlation between velocity dispersion and stellar mass, indicating these clusters are approaching energy equipartition or expanding. NGC 2516 and NGC 3532 exhibit a positive dependence between velocity dispersion and stellar mass, which may be attributed to the preferential ejection of massive stars following dynamical interactions involving binaries or black holes. These two clusters are the only two that are dynamical not relaxed and are closest to virial equilibrium. We compare the observations with N-body simulations of star clusters. A comparison of observed and simulated velocity dispersion profiles reveals that NGC 2516 and NGC 3532 exhibit lower proper motion dispersions than model clusters. Better agreement with the observed profiles is achieved for model clusters with larger ages. This suggests that the observed clusters may have undergone rapid dynamical evolution. Our results suggest that NGC 2516 and NGC 3532 may host at least two stellar-mass black holes each.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-latency analyses of gravitational-wave (GW) data from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA enable rapid detection of compact binary coalescences (CBC) and prompt sky localization, essential for electromagnetic follow-up in multi-messenger astronomy. We evaluate the performance and limitations of low-latency sky localization using BAYESTAR algorithm, and investigate the impact of low-significance Virgo triggers. We inject simulated CBC signals into Gaussian-stationary noise and into Virgo data from the second part of the third LIGO-Virgo observing run (O3b), then reconstruct skymaps across multiple detector network configurations. Localization accuracy is assessed using Percentile-Percentile plots, the Jaccard index, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Binary neutron star mergers are statistically consistent with ideal calibration, showing deviations below 3$\sigma$, particularly when Virgo is included in the network, whereas skymaps for neutron star--black hole and binary black hole mergers tend to be overconfident. Adding a third detector generally improves accuracy, but the searched area can degrade when Virgo's signal-to-noise ratio is low (SNR $\leq$ 5). For high-SNR events, relying on two detectors can mislocalize the source. Excluding Virgo can therefore cause the HL skymap to miss the true location when Virgo has strong antenna response, in such cases a three-detector configuration is required to recover the correct position and avoid misleading multi-messenger follow-up. We introduce diagnostics to flag problematic skymaps and apply them to O3 public alerts, recovering simulation-predicted trends and flagging a few anomalous morphologies. The results are relevant for improving rapid vetting of GW alerts and guiding observational strategies in multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-angle tail (WAT) and narrow-angle tail (NAT) radio active galactic nuclei (RAGNs) are key tracers of dense environments in galaxy groups and clusters, yet no machine-learning classifier of bent RAGNs has been trained using both unlabeled data and purely visually inspected labels. We release the RGC Python package, which includes two newly preprocessed labeled datasets of 639 WATs and NATs derived from a publicly available catalog of visually inspected sources, along with a semi-supervised RGC model that leverages 20,000 unlabeled RAGNs. The two labeled datasets in RGC were preprocessed using PyBDSF which retains spurious sources, and Photutils which removes them. The RGC model integrates the self-supervised framework BYOL (Bootstrap YOur Latent) with the supervised E2CNN (E2-equivariant Convolutional Neural Network) to form a semi-supervised binary classifier. The RGC model, when trained and evaluated on a dataset devoid of spurious sources, reaches peak performance, attaining an accuracy of 88.88% along with F1-scores of 0.90 for WATs and 0.85 for NATs. The model's attention patterns amid class imbalance suggest that this work can serve as a stepping stone toward developing physics-informed foundation models capable of identifying a broad range of AGN physical properties.
#### Ultraviolet Spectral Evidence for Ansky as a Slowly Evolving Featureless Tidal Disruption Event with Quasi-periodic Eruptions

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rare and enigmatic phenomena that increasingly show a connection to tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy ("Ansky") appear to be linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) rather than a TDE, as their slow decay and AGN-like variability differ markedly from that of typical TDEs. This finding may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky's nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines. Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power law with an index of -2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs. Compared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a significantly lower blackbody luminosity (10^43 erg s^-1) and much longer rise and decay timescales, suggesting a distinct TDE subclass. An offset TDE involving an intermediate-mass black hole is unlikely, given its position consistent with the galactic center with a 3 sigma upper limit of 54 pc. Instead, we propose that Ansky may result from the tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence star by a typical supermassive black hole. Our findings strengthen the growing evidence for TDE-QPE associations, although other formation channels for QPEs remain plausible and await future observational efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data of nano-Hertz gravitational waves released in 2023 implies that if such gravitational waves comes from the scalar perturbation induction at the end of inflation, the accompanied primordial black holes (PBHs) will be over-produced, with the fraction exceed the upper bound of unity. This is recognized as the ``overproduction problem", which calls for nontrivial features in the early universe. In this paper, we try to check out whether a modified dispersion relation (MDR) of the primordial perturbations can be helpful for solving the problem. From the constraint on PTA data, we obtain a posterior distribution of the parameters of primordial perturbation, and find that the MDR model, where the $k^4$ term becomes important at later time, can give rise to a broken-power-law (BPL) power spectrum which can alleviate the overproduction problem to nearly $2\sigma$ level. However, to improve furtherly into $1\sigma$ still needs small negative non-Gaussianity, e.g. $f_{\rm nl}\simeq -1$. The mass distribution of the PBHs generated is also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a large observational sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the spatial alignment between galaxy pairs and their local cosmic filaments. Focusing on pairs with stellar masses and separations comparable to the Milky Way-Andromeda (MW-M31) system, we measure the angle between the pair connecting line and the orientation of the host filament, determined using a filament catalog constructed via the Bisous model. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant tendency of galaxy pairs to align their connecting lines along their host filaments, manifesting as an overall $\sim$7\% excess of alignment angles smaller than the MW-M31 case compared to a random distribution. Crucially, the strength of this alignment exhibits a strong dependence on the distance to the filament spine. Pairs located within 0.2 Mpc from the filament spine show the strongest alignment, while those beyond 1 Mpc display no significant alignment. Furthermore, we identify a bimodal distribution of alignment angles near filament cores, suggesting distinct dynamical populations potentially associated with infall and interaction processes. Our results provide robust observational support for theoretical models in which anisotropic accretion and tidal forces within the cosmic web drive galaxy pair evolution. They also position the MW-M31 system as a representative filament-aligned pair, offering insights into Local Group assembly. This study demonstrates the cosmic web's critical role in dictating pair orientations and motivates future work with kinematic data to unravel galaxy-environment interplay.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $M_{BH} \approx 10^{3-5} M_\odot$) play a critical role in understanding the formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe. In this study, we expand on Nguyen et al. simulated measurements of IMBH masses using stellar kinematics, which will be observed with the High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral (HARMONI) field spectrograph on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) up to the distance of 20 Mpc. Our sample focuses on both the Virgo Cluster in the northern sky and the Fornax Cluster in the southern sky. We begin by identifying dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters, which are thought to be nurseries for IMBHs in the local universe. As a case study, we conduct simulations for FCC 119, the second faintest dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster at 20 Mpc, which is also fainter than most of Virgo Cluster members. We use the galaxy's surface brightness profile from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, combined with an assumed synthetic spectrum, to create mock observations with the {\tt HSIM} simulator and Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM). These mock HARMONI datacubes are analyzed as if they were real observations, employing JAM within a Bayesian framework to infer IMBH masses and their associated uncertainties. We find that ELT/HARMONI can detect the stellar kinematic signature of an IMBH and accurately measure its mass for $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$ out to distances of $\sim$20 Mpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Flare ribbons serve as chromospheric footprints of energy deposition resulting from particle acceleration during magnetic reconnection. Their fine-scale structure provides a valuable tool for probing the dynamics of the flare reconnection process. Our goal is to investigate the fine-scale structure of flare ribbons through multiple observations of flares, utilising data obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). The aligned AIA and SST datasets for the three solar flares were used to examine their overall morphology. The SST datasets were specifically used to identify fine-scale structures within the flare ribbons. For spectroscopic analysis of these fine structures, we applied machine-learning methods (k-means clustering) and Gaussian fitting. Using k-means, we identified elongated features in the flare ribbons, termed as "riblets", which are short-lived and jet-like small-scale structures that extend as plasma columns from the flare ribbons. Riblets are more prominent near the solar limb and represent the ribbon front. Riblet widths are consistent across observations, ranging from 110-310 km (0".15-0".41), while vertical lengths span 620-1220 km (0".83-1".66), with a potential maximum of 2000 km (2".67), after accounting for projection effects. Detailed H-beta spectral analysis reveals that riblets exhibit a single, redshifted emission component, with velocities of 16-21 km s^1, independent of viewing angle. Our high-resolution observations of the three flare ribbons show that they are not continuous structures, but are composed of vertically extended, fine-scale substructures. These irregular features indicate that the reconnection region is not a smooth, laminar current sheet, but rather a fragmented zone filled with magnetic islands, consistent with the theory of patchy reconnection within the coronal current sheet.

 - **Abstract**
 In a hierarchical $\Lambda$CDM Universe, cosmic filaments serve as the primary channels for matter accretion into galaxy clusters, influencing the shape of their dark matter halos. We investigate whether the elongation of galaxy clusters correlates with the orientation of surrounding filaments, providing the first observational test of this relationship in large supercluster regions. We identified and characterized cosmic filaments in two dimensions within the two superclusters that are part of the low-redshift sub-survey of the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES): the Shapley supercluster and the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster. We analyzed the alignment between filament directions --traced by galaxy distributions- and the triaxiality of cluster gravitational potentials --traced by X-ray emission- using publicly available optical and X-ray data. We have found that most (82%) of the X-ray clusters are associated with and interconnected by the optically detected filaments. The clusters-filaments alignment analysis shows that the elongation of most clusters is well aligned with nearby filaments, providing observational confirmation of theoretical predictions, with the alignment progressively reducing at larger cluster-centric distances ($> 1.6 r_{200}$). Overall, our results support the notion that filaments are the main source of galaxy accretion at redshift below 0.1 and additionally provide evidence that matter accretion through filaments shapes the gravitational potential of galaxy clusters. We propose this measurement as a simple observational proxy to determine the direction of accretion in clusters, which is key to understanding both galaxy evolution and the merger history of galaxy clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 A major goal of computational astrophysics is to simulate the Milky Way Galaxy with sufficient resolution down to individual stars. However, the scaling fails due to some small-scale, short-timescale phenomena, such as supernova explosions. We have developed a novel integration scheme of $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.

 - **Abstract**
 Multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations have transformed the study of stellar interiors over the past few decades. Most codes developed during that time use the anelastic approximation, which fixes the thermal structure of simulations and filters out sound waves. Many of them also use explicit time integration, which imposes severe constraints on the time step of the simulations. In this context, MUSIC is developed to overcome these limitations. Its main scientific objective is to improve the phenomenological approaches used in 1D stellar evolution codes to describe major hydrodynamical and MHD processes. Here, we review recent applications of the MUSIC code, that focus mainly on convection, convective boundary mixing and waves in stars that possess convective cores, shells and/or envelopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Vine is a massive protocluster at z=3.44 in the JWST CEERS field, offering an ideal laboratory for studying the early phases of cluster formation. Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M*/Msun)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z>3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M*/Msun) > 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)>10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/Msun)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/Msun)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.

 This work is part of a series establishing the redshift framework for the $3\times2$pt analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6). For DES Y6, photometric redshift distributions are estimated using self-organizing maps (SOMs), calibrated with spectroscopic and many-band photometric data. To overcome limitations from color-redshift degeneracies and incomplete spectroscopic coverage, we enhance this approach by incorporating clustering-based redshift constraints (clustering-z, or WZ) from angular cross-correlations with BOSS and eBOSS galaxies, and eBOSS quasar samples. We define a WZ likelihood and apply importance sampling to a large ensemble of SOM-derived $n(z)$ realizations, selecting those consistent with the clustering measurements to produce a posterior sample for each lens and source bin. The analysis uses angular scales of 1.5-5 Mpc to optimize signal-to-noise while mitigating modeling uncertainties, and marginalizes over redshift-dependent galaxy bias and other systematics informed by the N-body simulation Cardinal. While a sparser spectroscopic reference sample limits WZ constraining power at $z>1.1$, particularly for source bins, we demonstrate that combining SOMPZ with WZ improves redshift accuracy and enhances the overall cosmological constraining power of DES Y6. We estimate an improvement in $S_8$ of approximately 10\% for cosmic shear and $3\times2$pt analysis, primarily due to the WZ calibration of the source samples.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a stack of data from the second season of the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder on the positions of quasars from eBOSS and DESI. COMAP is a Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiment targeting dense molecular gas via CO(1--0) emission at $z\sim3$. COMAP's Season 2 represents a $3\times$ increase in map-level sensitivity over the previous Early Science data release. We do not detect any CO emission in the stack, instead finding an upper limit of $10.0\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{K\ km\ s^{-1}\ pc^2}$ at 95\% confidence within an $\sim 18\ \mathrm{cMpc}$ box. We compare this upper limit to models of the CO emission stacked on quasars and find a tentative ($\sim 3 \sigma$) tension between the limit and the brightest stack models after accounting for a suite of additional sources of experimental attenuation and uncertainty, including quasar velocity uncertainty, pipeline signal loss, cosmic variance, and interloper emission in the LIM data. The COMAP-eBOSS/DESI stack is primarily a measurement of the CO luminosity in the quasars' wider environment and is therefore potentially subject to environmental effects such as feedback. With our current simple models of the galaxy-halo connection, we are thus unable to confidently rule out any models of cosmic CO with the stack alone. Conversely, the stack's sensitivity to these large-scale environmental effects has the potential to make it a powerful tool for galaxy formation science, once we are able to constrain the average CO luminosity via the auto power spectrum (a key goal of COMAP).

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological studies of the Lyman-Alpha (Lya) forest typically constrain parameters using two-point statistics. However, higher-order statistics, such as the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer additional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and power spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To address this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the bispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level bispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field theory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on synthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the transmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the bispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian smoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the statistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum prediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k <= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the cosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use a line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew spectra. These probe non-squeezed bispectrum triangles and avoid locally applying quadratic operators to the field by displacing one copy of the field in the radial direction. Using a fixed displacement of 40 Mpc/h (and line-of-sight smoothing of 10 Mpc/h) yields a similar agreement with the theory prediction. For the special case of correlating the squared (and displaced) field with the original one, we analytically forward model the window function making this approach readily applicable to DESI data.
