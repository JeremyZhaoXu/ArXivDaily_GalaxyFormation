#### Hunting for the First Explosions at the High-Redshift Frontier

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spectroscopically confirmed galaxies up to $z\sim14$, 300 Myr after the Big Bang, and several candidates have been discovered at $z\sim15-25$, with one candidate as high as $z\sim30$, only 100 Myr after the Big Bang. Such objects are unexpected, since theoretical studies have not predicted the existence of detectable galaxies at $z\sim30$. While any $z\sim30$ candidates may be contaminants at lower redshifts, we explore whether such extreme redshift sources could be consistent with hyper-energetic transient events linked to the formation of the first, metal-free, stars. Specifically, we consider pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), a predicted class of extreme thermonuclear explosions that leave no remnant behind. Using cosmological simulations, we investigate an overdense cosmic region, where star formation and subsequent PISNe occur at $z\sim30-40$, even within standard cosmology. Assessing the likelihood of such a region, the corresponding number of PISNe at $z\gtrsim20$, and their observed flux, we find that JWST has a non-negligible chance to detect a PISN event at extremely high redshifts. If a transient event were confirmed at $z\sim30$, this would provide a direct glimpse into the epoch of first star formation, dramatically extending the empirical reach of astronomy.
#### The Maximum Gravity Model for partial Tidal Disruption Events: Mass Loss, Peak Fallback Rate and Dependence on Stellar Properties

 - **Abstract**
 A star entering the tidal sphere of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be partially stripped of mass, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (TDE). Here we develop an analytical model for properties of these events, including the peak fallback rate, $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$, the time at which the peak occurs, $t_{\rm peak}$, and the amount of mass removed from the star, $\Delta M$, for any star and any pericenter distance associated with the stellar orbit about the black hole. We compare the model predictions to 1276 hydrodynamical simulations of partial TDEs of main-sequence stars by a $10^6 M_\odot$ SMBH. The model yields $t_{\rm peak}$ predictions that are in good agreement (to within tens of percent) with the numerical simulations for any stellar mass and age. The agreement for $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$ is weaker due to the influence of self-gravity on the debris stream dynamics, which remains dynamically important for partial TDEs; the agreement for $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$ is, however, to within a factor of $\sim 2-3$ in the majority of cases considered, with larger differences for low-mass stars ($M_\star \lesssim 0.5 M_\odot$) on grazing orbits with small mass loss. We show that partial TDE lightcurves for disruptions caused by $\sim 10^6M_\odot$ SMBHs can span $\sim 20-100$ day peak timescales, whereas grazing encounters of high-mass stars with high-mass SMBHs can yield longer peak timescales ($t\gtrsim 1000$ days), associated with some observed transients. Our model provides a significant step toward an analytical prescription for TDE lightcurves and luminosity functions.
#### Dynamical Origins of Azimuthal Metallicity Variations in the Galactic Disk: Insights from Kinematic Ridges with Gaia

 - **Abstract**
 Kinematic and spectroscopic studies in the past few years have revealed coherent azimuthal metallicity variations across the Milky Way's disk that may be the result of dynamical processes associated with non-axisymmetric features of the Galaxy. At the same time, stellar kinematics from Gaia have uncovered ridge-like features in the velocity space, raising the question of whether these chemical and dynamical substructures share a common origin. Using a sample of disk stars from Gaia DR3, we find that azimuthal metallicity variations are correlated with kinematic ridges in the V_phi-R plane, suggesting a shared origin. We utilize a suite of Milky Way test-particle simulations to assess the role of transient spiral arms, the bar, and interactions with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy in simultaneously shaping both chemical and kinematic substructures. Among the physical mechanisms explored, bar and spiral arm interactions are the ones that consistently reproduce both the chemo-kinematic features and alignment observed in the Gaia data. While our model of an interaction with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy can also induce kinematic and metallicity substructure, the amplitude of the azimuthal metallicity variations are too weak, suggesting this is likely not the dominant influence. Although additional contributing processes cannot be ruled out, the azimuthal metallicity variations observed in Gaia are best explained by a dynamical origin. Our results support the view that that azimuthal metallicity variations in the Galaxy are driven by similar dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the kinematic ridges and co-moving groups.
#### Gas rotation and turbulence in the galaxy cluster Abell 2029

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the rotation and turbulent support of the intracluster medium (ICM) in Abell 2029 (A2029), using dynamical equilibrium models and a combination of state-of-the-art X-ray datasets. We reduce and conduct the spectral analysis of the XRISM/Resolve data. The rotating, turbulent ICM in the model has a composite polytropic distribution in equilibrium in a spherically-symmetric, cosmologically motivated dark halo. The profile of rotation velocity and the distribution of turbulent velocity dispersion are described with flexible functional forms, consistent with the properties of synthetic clusters formed in cosmological simulations. Adopting realistic profiles for the metallicity distribution of the ICM and for the point spread function of XRISM and XMM-Newton, we tune via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm the observables of the intrinsic quantities of the plasma in our model to reproduce the radial profiles of the thermodynamic quantities as derived from the spectral analysis of the XMM-Newton and Planck maps and the measurements of the line-of-sight (LOS) non-thermal velocity dispersion and redshift (probing the LOS velocity) in the XRISM pointings. Our model accurately reproduces the measurements of redshift and LOS non-thermal velocity dispersion, as further demonstrated by simulating and analyzing synthetic counterparts of the XRISM spectra, in accordance with the posterior distribution of our model. We find turbulence-to-total pressure ratio $\approx$ 2% across the (0 - 650) kpc radial range, and a rotation-to-dispersion velocity ratio peaking at 0.15 between 200 - 600 kpc. The hydrostatic-to-total mass ratio is $\approx$ 0.97 at r2500, the radius enclosing an overdensity of 2500 times the average value.
#### The origin of strong $α$-element bimodalities in FIRE simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 One of the Milky Way's characteristic features is a strongly bimodal distribution of $\alpha$-process elements, such as Mg, at fixed [Fe/H] in stellar abundances. We examine patterns in [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] in FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. Out of 16 galaxies, 4 are capable of producing a strongly bimodal distribution. In all four galaxies, the high-$\alpha$ population corresponds to an older, radially-compact, thick disk, and the low-$\alpha$ population corresponds to a younger, radially-extended, thin disk, similar to the this http URL transition from high- to low-$\alpha$ took $0.3-1.2\Gyr$ and began $5.5-6.5\Gyr$ ago. [Mg/Fe] decreased at relatively fixed [Fe/H], both in the galaxy overall and at fixed radii: Fe enrichment nearly balanced gas accretion (and therefore dilution), but Mg enrichment was weaker. Importantly, this transition occurred during a period of relatively low gas fraction ($5-15\%$), immediately after a rapid decline in star formation (halving within a few hundred Myr), which caused an increase in Fe-producing white-dwarf supernovae relative to Mg-producing core-collapse supernovae. Only one case coincided with a major merger coalescence. We find similar trends in measuring stars by their current radius and by their birth radius, therefore, radial redistribution did not play a dominant role in the formation of a bimodality or its spatial dependence today. Overall, in FIRE-2, strong $\alpha$-element bimodalities are relatively uncommon ($\sim25\%$), often not associated with a major merger, and arise primarily from a rapid decline in star formation during relatively low gas fraction.
#### COUGS-DESI: A Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with Polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Polar-structure galaxies (PSGs) host photometrically and kinematically decoupled components oriented at large angles to one another. These systems, which include polar rings, polar disks, polar halos, polar bulges, polar dust lanes, and polar tidal structures, provide valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution, although their rarity has limited statistical studies. We aim to construct the largest and most homogeneous catalog of PSGs to date in order to enable robust statistical studies of their properties and occurrence rates in the local Universe. Using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR10) data, we identified PSG candidates in the Siena Galaxy Atlas (SGA) through visual inspection, convolutional neural network classification, and cross-matching with previously reported systems. Each galaxy was assigned a PSG subtype and host morphology. We analyzed general properties of PSGs and compared them with those for all galaxies in the SGA. Simple image simulations were used to evaluate projection effects. The resulting Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (COUGS-DESI) contains 2,989 PSG candidates, including 342 previously known objects. Projection effects from random galaxy overlaps are negligible. The sample spans a wide range of polar morphologies, with 1,113 polar rings, 75 polar bulges, 216 polar halos, 185 polar dust lanes, and 1,315 polar tidal structures. PSGs constitute 2.2% of local non-dwarf galaxies, with polar rings representing 0.7%. Approximately 1% of S0 galaxies in the SGA host polar rings, whereas spirals constitute the most common morphological type among the PSG hosts in our catalog. COUGS--DESI increases the number of known PSG candidates by an order of magnitude and provides a foundation for detailed studies of the formation and evolution of polar structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Subhalo spin is essential for modeling galaxy formation and controlling systematic uncertainties in intrinsic alignment (IA) studies. However, the physical mechanisms governing subhalo spin acquisition within the tidal environments of host halos remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the alignment between subhalo and host halo spins using the high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, Shin-Uchuu. We find that the spin alignment between subhalos and host halos becomes increasingly pronounced toward the central regions. Our analysis reveals that subhalos typically acquire spin in the same direction as their orbital angular momentum. Since the orbital angular momentum of most subhalos is aligned with the host halo spin, an overall alignment between subhalo and host spins emerges. When classified by orbital orientation, however, subhalo spins in the inner regions are found to be oriented perpendicularly or anti-parallel to the host spin for polar and retrograde orbits, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that subhalo spins are acquired through torques exerted by the tidal field of the host halo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mass ratio and the radial distance from the host center are the primary parameters governing subhalo spin alignment, while the dependence on the accretion redshift is found to be negligible.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic dust plays a vital role in stellar and galactic formation and evolution, but its three-dimensional structure in the Milky Way has remained unclear due to insufficient precise reddening and distance measurements. Although early studies typically adopted a single-disk model, we detect two distinct components at Galactocentric distances of 5-14 kpc, enabled by photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric measurements of over 5 million stars. The thin dust disk's scale height increases radially from 60 to 200 pc, while the thick disk grows from 300 to 800 pc. For the first time, we find the thin and thick dust disk correlates spatially with molecular and atomic hydrogen disk, respectively. The thin, thick, and combined disks have scale lengths of 9.6+1.2-1.1 kpc, 4.2+0.4-0.3 kpc, and 6.6+0.3-0.3 kpc, respectively. The gas-to-dust ratio shows an exponential radial gradient, increasing from around 60 at 5 kpc to around 470 at 14 kpc. These findings provide new insights into dust morphology in the Galaxy and raise fundamental questions that require further investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new fiber assignment algorithm for a robotic fiber positioner system in multi-object spectroscopy. Modern fiber positioner systems typically have overlapping patrol regions, resulting in the number of observable targets being highly dependent on the fiber assignment scheme. To maximize observable targets without fiber collisions, the algorithm proceeds in three steps. First, it assigns the maximum number of targets for a given field of view without considering any collisions between fiber positioners. Then, the fibers in collision are grouped, and the algorithm finds the optimal solution resolving the collision problem within each group. We compare the results from this new algorithm with those from a simple algorithm that assigns targets in descending order of their rank by considering collisions. As a result, we could increase the overall completeness of target assignments by 10% with this new algorithm in comparison with the case using the simple algorithm in a field with 150 fibers. Our new algorithm is designed for the All-sky SPECtroscopic survey of nearby galaxies (A-SPEC) based on the K-SPEC spectrograph system, but can also be applied to similar fiber-based systems with heavily overlapping fiber positioners.

 - **Abstract**
 Line intensity mapping using atomic hydrogen (HI) has the potential to efficiently map large volumes of the universe if the signal can be successfully separated from overwhelmingly bright radio foreground emission. This motivates cross-correlations, to ascertain the cosmological nature of measured HI fluctuations, and to study their connections with galaxies and the underlying matter density field. However, these same foregrounds render the cross-correlation with projected fields such as the lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) difficult. Indeed, the correlated Fourier modes vary slowly along the line of sight, and are thus most contaminated by the smooth-spectrum radio continuum foregrounds. In this paper, we implement a method that avoids this issue by attempting to measure the non-linear gravitational coupling of the small-scale 21cm power from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) with large-scale Planck CMB lensing. This measurement is a position-dependent power spectrum, i.e. a squeezed integrated bispectrum. Using 94 nights of CHIME data between $1.0 < z < 1.3$ and aggressive foreground filtering, we find that the expected signal is five times smaller than the current noise. We forecast that incorporating the additional nights of CHIME data already collected would enable a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, without any further improvements in filtering for foreground cleaning.
