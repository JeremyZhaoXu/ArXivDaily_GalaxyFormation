 - **Abstract**
 Carbon (C) is thought to be produced by both core collapse supernovae (CCSN) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, but the relative contributions of these two sources are uncertain. We investigate the astrophysical origin of C using models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) appropriate for the Milky Way disk. We benchmark our results against APOGEE subgiant abundances. The trend between [C/Mg] and [Mg/H] is set by the total C yield as a function of metallicity. Observations indicate a gently rising [C/Mg] with [Mg/H], but AGB C production is predicted to decline with metallicity. Our sample therefore favours a scenario in which CCSN yields rise with metallicity to offset declining AGB C yields and drive a subtle increase in [C/Mg] with [Mg/H]. This result is consistent with massive star nucleosynthesis models incorporating rotation. The [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend is sensitive to delayed enrichment and therefore constrains the amount of AGB C production. Given the slope of this relation, we find that AGB stars likely account for 10-40 per cent of C at solar metallicity. Artificially shifting the AGB C yields towards lower mass stars with longer lifetimes also improves agreement with the observed [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend, possibly indicating a discrepancy with stellar evolution predictions or our assumed Fe production rate.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic comparison between {\it XMM-Newton} velocity maps of the Virgo, Centaurus, Ophiuchus and A3266 clusters and synthetic velocity maps generated from the Illustris TNG-300 simulations. Our goal is to constrain the physical conditions and dynamical states of the intracluster medium (ICM) through a data-driven approach. We employ a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify the most analogous simulated cluster to each observed system based on the morphology of their line-of-sight velocity maps. The model learns a high-dimensional similarity metric between observations and simulations, allowing us to capture subtle kinematic and structural patterns beyond traditional statistical tests. We find that the best-matching simulated halos reproduce the observed large-scale velocity gradients and local kinematic substructures, suggesting that the ICM motions in these clusters arise from a combination of gas sloshing, AGN feedback, and minor merger activity. Our results demonstrate that deep learning provides a powerful and objective framework for connecting X-ray observations to cosmological simulations, offering new insights into the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters and the mechanisms driving turbulence and bulk flows in the hot ICM.
#### Oscillations of dark matter halos in galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic matter and dark matter in galaxies represent two substances linked by the gravitational interaction. Collisions of galaxies may create an offset between the centers of mass of these two components. Ignoring internal dynamics of particles in the dark matter halo and Keplerian rotations of stars in the galaxy, we focus on possible relative oscillations of the visible matter in the dark matter halo. This two-fluid model is somewhat similar to the ``giant dipole resonances'' in nuclei. We estimate possible amplitude and frequency of such oscillations assuming that the offset of the centers of mass is small as compared with the size of the galaxy. Such oscillations, if exist, should manifest themselves in anomalies of velocities of stars in the galaxy, such as the density waves and runaway stars which have orbit periods in resonance with oscillations. These matter -- dark matter oscillations may affect direction and magnitude of the dark matter wind coming to Earth.
#### The FAST-SETI Milky Way Globular Cluster Survey I: A Pilot Multibeam On-the-Fly Search of Five Globular Clusters at L-Band
 - **Authors:** Bo-Lun Huang, Zhen-Zhao Tao, Tong-Jie Zhang, Vishal Gajjar

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21085

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21085

 - **Abstract**
 We report a narrowband technosignature search toward five Milky Way globular clusters (NGC 6171, NGC 6218, NGC 6254, NGC 6838, and IC 1276) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) 19-beam L-band receiver (1.05-1.45 GHz). We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| <= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N >= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems.
#### Constraints on Features in the Cosmological Power Spectrum from Observations of the Epoch of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 We consider cosmological models with a power spectrum of perturbations featuring an enhanced amplitude on dwarf galaxy scales (with a "bump" or a "tilt"). Early formation of a large number of galaxies in such models, compared to the standard spectrum, can shift the epoch of reionization to higher redshifts compared to observations. We show that for moderate bump amplitude $\mathcal{A}<1.5-2$, the considered models are not ruled out by observations of reionization at $z \approx 8$ due to existing uncertainties in the fraction of ultraviolet photons escaping galaxies, $f_{esc}$, and inhomogeneity of the neutral hydrogen distribution.
#### Molybdenum and ruthenium in the Galactic disk: A closer look at their nucleosynthesis components

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar origin of the elements molybdenum (Mo, Z=42) and ruthenium (Ru, Z=44) is still a matter of debate. Studying their abundances provides valuable insights into nucleosynthesis processes and the broader evolution of neutron-capture elements. We presented new observations of Mo and Ru, together with nearby neutron-capture elements strontium (Sr) and zirconium (Zr) for a new sample of 154 giant stars, located in the Galactic disk with metallicities -1 < [Fe/H] < +0.3. The abundances were determined under the assumption of the local thermodynamic equilibrium by fitting synthetic spectra. The abundances of Mo were derived from the Mo I lines at 5506 and 5533 A, the abundances of Ru were determined from Ru I lines at 4584, and 4757 A. For most of the giant stars observed in this work, Mo and Ru abundances were determined for the first time. We compare our observations with the signatures from different nucleosynthesis processes. Both the [Mo/Fe] and [Ru/Fe] in our stars show a decreasing trend with respect to increasing [Fe/H]. This pattern is similar to that of [Zr/Fe], whereas [Sr/Fe] exhibits a relatively flat trend with metallicity. Compared to the s-process ratios, all stars show a lower [Zr/Mo] and a higher [Ru/Mo], as expected from classical nucleosynthesis. Still, it is unclear if additional contributions from neutrino-wind components or the i-process is needed to explain the observed scatter of [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] in the Milky Way disk. Indeed, such a dispersion is consistent with the variations also seen in r-II stars at low metallicity and could therefore result from the combined contributions of r-process and s-process to galactic chemical evolution. The observed [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] scatter in r-II stars should be constrained by future investigations to define if any contributions of additional nucleosynthesis components are needed.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs), which occur when stars enter the tidal radii of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and are subsequently torn apart by their tidal forces, represent intriguing phenomena that stimulate growing research interest and pose an increasing number of puzzles in the era of time-domain astronomy. Here we report an unusual X-ray transient, XID 935, discovered in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, the deepest X-ray survey ever. XID 935 experienced an overall X-ray dimming by a factor of more than 40 between 1999 and 2016. Not monotonically decreasing during this period, its X-ray luminosity increased by a factor $> 27$ within 2 months, from $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}<10^{40.87}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (10 October 2014 -- 4 January 2015) to $L_{\rm 0.5-7\ keV}=10^{42.31\pm 0.20}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (16 March 2015). The X-ray position of XID 935 is located at the center of its host galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of 0.251, whose optical spectra do not display emission characteristics associated with an active galactic nucleus. The peak 0.5--2.0 keV flux is the faintest among all the X-ray-selected TDE candidates to date. Thanks to a total exposure of $\sim 9.5$ Ms in the X-ray bands, we manage to secure relatively well-sampled, 20-year-long X-ray light curves of this deepest X-ray-selected TDE candidate. We find that a partial TDE model could not explain the main declining trend. An SMBH binary TDE model is in acceptable accordance with the light curves of XID 935; however, it fails to match short-timescale fluctuations exactly. Therefore, the exceptional observational features of XID 935 provide a key benchmark for refining quantitative TDE models and simulations.
