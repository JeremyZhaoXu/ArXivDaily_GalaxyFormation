#### Think inside the box: cosmic variance and large-scale conformity of high-redshift massive galaxies in the FLAMINGO simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We use the highest-resolution FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation to quantify cosmic variance and large-scale coherence in the evolution of massive galaxies at high redshift. FLAMINGO combines a $(1\,\mathrm{cGpc})^3$ volume with baryonic resolution sufficient to identify ${\gtrsim}\,10^3$ independent JWST-like survey volumes of $(100\,\mathrm{cMpc})^3$, providing unprecedented statistics to characterize the extremes of cosmic variance. At $z\,{\simeq}\,6$, the total variance in the number of haloes with $M_{200}\,{\simeq}\,10^{11.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (or $M_\ast\,{\simeq}\,10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) is 2--3 times the Poisson expectation, while this ratio decreases with redshift. Similarly, at $z\,{\gtrsim}\,4$, the variance in the most massive halo per JWST-like field is twice the Poisson prediction. We find a pronounced large-scale \emph{conformity}: in volumes ranked by the stellar mass of their most massive galaxy ($M_{\ast,\mathrm{max}}$), the stellar-to-halo mass relation and star-formation efficiency are coherently elevated or suppressed throughout the full $(100\,\mathrm{cMpc})^3$ volume. When accounting for galaxies outside the volume, this signal persists only to radii $\lesssim 50\,\mathrm{cMpc}$, demonstrating that the detectable conformity is enhanced by the survey footprint. Moreover, $M_{\ast,\mathrm{max}}$ is a better predictor of the volume-wide efficiency of massive galaxies than the total number counts, which mainly trace clustering. Finally, the stellar fraction of the most massive galaxies peaks at $f_\ast\,{=}\,M_\ast\,/\,(M_{200}f_{\rm b,cosmic})\,{\simeq}\,0.2$ at $z\,{\simeq}\,5$, with a narrower dispersion in $f_\ast$ at fixed redshift and stronger redshift evolution than commonly assumed. These results show that both cosmic variance and footprint-confined conformity must be modelled when interpreting early massive galaxy populations in JWST fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Mixing between dark photons and visible photons leads to substantial anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background due to resonant conversions of visible photons into dark photons in baryonic matter found in dark matter halos. In this Letter, we forecast the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to this signal. We find that SKA could be the first experiment to discover dark photons with a mass between $10^{-13}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as small as $\sim 10^{-8}$ by cross-correlating their data with a low-redshift galaxy survey, potentially improving on the sensitivity from a similar analysis using Planck data by a factor of 4 in $\epsilon$. This improvement is largely due to an enhancement of the signal at low frequencies and the unique experimental advantages of radio telescopes such as small beam sizes.
#### Fractional Dynamics in Galactic Nuclei: Non-Local Transport, Transient Phenomena and the Nullification of the Schwarzschild Barrier

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate the necessity of fractional calculus for modeling anomalous diffusion in stellar dynamics, specifically Resonant Relaxation (RR) near a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Standard transport theories rely on the local Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, a formalism restricted to Gaussian processes governed by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). This approach fails for RR, which is a superdiffusive Lévy flight characterized by non-local transport and governed by the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT). We apply the space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), utilizing non-local Riemann-Liouville operators, to resolve major discrepancies between local theory and observations. In transient regimes, the FFPE predicts an immediate, linear flux ($\Gamma(t) \propto t$), consistent with high Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) rates in post-starburst galaxies, whereas local FP models predict an unphysical exponential delay ($\Gamma(t) \propto \exp(-C/t)$). Furthermore, we prove mathematically that the non-local integral operators permit ``barrier jumping''. This mechanism nullifies transport bottlenecks like the proposed Schwarzschild Barrier (SB). Local models incorrectly interpret the SB as severely suppressing Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) rates. We validate our theoretical findings using direct-summation $N$-body simulations incorporating relativistic corrections. The simulations confirm that particle flux remains continuous across the SB in the regime where RR dominates, demonstrating that the barrier does not inhibit EMRI production. The fractional framework provides the correct physical description for non-local transport, resolving long-standing problems concerning TDE and EMRI rates.
#### The origin of scatter in the X-ray luminosity - halo mass relation of galaxy clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy groups and clusters are excellent probes of large-scale structure and are shaped by some of the most energetic physical processes in the Universe. They follow a tight scaling relation of X-ray luminosity with halo mass. However, predicting the dependence of the scatter in this relation on mass and redshift is challenging, due to the statistical requirement of large simulation volumes. Using the large volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations for galaxy cluster physics FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster, we fit this relation and its scatter, focusing on $M_{\rm 500c}>10^{13}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $z \leq 2$. We find qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different results for the two models. For the first time, we study ways to reduce the scatter using properties beyond X-ray luminosity, namely six ICM, six galaxy, and eleven dark matter halo properties. For both FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster, the gas fraction and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal correlate strongest with X-ray scatter, reducing it by over 50% when accounting for their partial correlations. Galaxy and halo properties correlate weakly with X-ray scatter, typically reducing it by 10-20%. Our results are qualitatively robust across different FLAMINGO feedback variations, though the correlations weaken for stronger feedback and with increasing redshift. Differences between FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster are only apparent at the high-mass end - where e.g. the galaxy stellar age correlates strongly for FLAMINGO, but not for TNG300+TNG-Cluster - confirming robustness across physics implementations. We provide fitting formulas for the scatter and its corrections, for direct application to cosmological analyses and observational data.
#### Measuring the Dark Matter Self-Interaction Cross-Section with Deep Compact Clustering for Robust Machine Learning Inference

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a machine learning algorithm capable of detecting ``out-of-domain data'' for trustworthy cosmological inference. By using data from two separate suites of cosmological simulations, we show that our algorithm is able to determine whether ``observed'' data is consistent with its training domain, returning confidence estimates as well as accurate parameter estimations. We apply our algorithm to two-dimensional images of galaxy clusters from the BAHAMAS-SIDM and DARKSKIES simulations with the aim to measure the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter. Through deep compact clustering we construct an informative latent space where galaxy clusters are mapped to the latent space forming ``latent-clusters'' for each simulation, with the location of the latent-cluster corresponding to the macroscopic parameters, such as the cross-section, $\sigma_{\rm DM}/m$. We then pass through mock observations, where the location of the observed latent-cluster informs us of which properties are shared with the training data. If the observed latent-cluster shares no similarities with latent-clusters from the known simulations, we can conclude that our simulations do not represent the observations and discard any parameter estimations, thus providing us with a method to measure machine learning confidence. This method serves as a blueprint for transparent and robust inference that is in demand in scientific machine learning.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the GALPROP cosmic ray (CR) propagation framework to model the diffuse neutrino and gamma-ray emissions from the Galaxy. A collection of realistic bounding models are developed and predictions of the resulting neutrino and gamma-ray signals are compared to the IceCube and LHAASO data up to PeV energies. We find that all the GALPROP models are consistent with the neutrino data within uncertainties. They are also consistent with expectations of neutrino emissions derived from LHAASO data when accounting for possible gamma-ray point source contamination. The new models present state-of-the-art predictions for the VHE neutrino emissions from the Galaxy that may be used for future neutrino searches.
#### JWST View of the Supernebula in NGC 5253. I. Overview and Continuum Features

 - **Abstract**
 We present imaging spectroscopy of the "supernebula" in the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 with the MIRI-MRS integral field spectrometer of the JWST. NGC 5253 is host to an luminous ($L\sim 10^9~\rm L_\odot$) HII region, powered by a giant young star cluster, a possible local analogue to super star cluster formation at Cosmic Dawn and Noon. In this paper, the first in a series about the mid-infrared line and continuum emission in the center of NGC 5253, we present an overview and continuum spectra. The mid-infrared images reveal four sources of continuum emission from hot dust that we identify as luminous HII regions, which are used to define spectral apertures. The dominant continuum source is the pc-scale supernebula core seen at radio wavelengths. We find that the MIR to radio continuum flux ratio for all regions is identical to that of Galactic HII regions. The 9.7 silicate feature is present and strongest in absorption toward the supernebula. Silicate emission is seen in another HII region. PAH features are present, although weak, particularly in the supernebula; the strongest emission is in an HII region only 15 pc from the supernebula core. PAH features at 6.2$\mu$m and 11.3$\mu$m are detected in all sources. Comparison of the luminosity implied by the ionization to the observed infrared luminosity suggest that at least 25% ofthe photons are escaping the embedded supernebula core, in spite of its high, $A_V\gtrsim 15$, extinction.

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby dwarf starburst NGC 5253 is dominated by a compact radio-infrared supernebula powered by a very young and bright embedded Super Star Cluster (SSC) of $\sim 10^9 L_\odot$. We observed this source and its surroundings over the 5-25$\mu$m range with MIRI/MRS on JWST and in Paper I presented the JWST view of the region and its continuum features. We now present the more than 70 emission lines of HI, $H_2$ and metal ions detected by MIRI/MRS. We derive the extinction by comparing HI recombination to the free-free radio continuum and find that it is very flat, i.e., almost independent of wavelength, over this spectral range. Nebular conditions are consistent with young ($\lesssim5\times10^6$ years) and very massive stars. All regions show high excitation, but the spatial distribution of the high excitation lines suggests that photons with energies close to 50eV are escaping the supernebula core in spite of 35 magnitudes of visual extinction.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological bounds on the sum of neutrino masses, M_nu = sum m_nu, are in tension with laboratory oscillation experiments, making cosmological tests of neutrino free-streaming imperative. In order to study the scale-dependent clustering of massive neutrinos, we develop a fast linear response method, FAST-nu f, applicable to neutrinos and other non-relativistic hot dark matter. Using it as an accurate linear approximation to help us reduce the dynamic range of emulator training data, based upon a non-linear perturbation theory for massive neutrinos, we improve the emulator's accuracy at small M_nu and length scales by a factor of two. We significantly sharpen its momentum resolution for the slowest neutrinos, which, despite their small mass fraction, dominate small-scale clustering. Furthermore, we extend the emulator from the degenerate to the normal and inverted mass orderings. Applying this new emulator, Cosmic-Enu-II, to large halos in N-body simulations, we show that non-linear perturbation theory can reproduce the neutrino density profile in the halo outskirts, 2R_vir < r < 10R_vir , to better than 10%.

 - **Abstract**
 Warm inflation is a well-motivated and generalized framework of inflation, describing a coupled inflaton-radiation bath. In this work, we investigate a warm inflation model with a quartic potential and a composite dissipation coefficient $\Upsilon(\phi, T) = C_1 \frac{T^3}{M_{\text{Pl}}^2} + C_2 \frac{T^3}{\phi^2}.$ The two terms in $\Upsilon$ dominate at different scales: the first term governs the early inflationary dynamics at large (CMB) scales, while the second term becomes significant at smaller scales. The model features two distinct stages of inflation: an initial phase where strong dissipation ($Q \gg 1$) generates a red-tilted primordial spectrum consistent with CMB observations (from ACT), followed by a second phase producing a blue-tilted spectrum with a significant amplification of power at small scales, leading to primordial black hole formation. We analyze the effects of key parameters -- like the duration of each inflationary phase, the slow-roll parameter at the end of the first phase, the dissipation strength at the pivot scale, and the choice of the growth function -- on the primordial power spectrum and its spectral index. Additionally, we examine the consistency of the model with the swampland distance conjecture and trans-Planckian conjecture, needed for embedding these models with some UV complete theories. This work highlights the potential of warm inflation with a composite dissipation coefficient to reconcile large-scale CMB measurements with small-scale structure formation.
#### Impact of selection criteria on the structural parameters of the Galactic thin and thick discs

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The Milky Way contains a thick and a thin disc that differ in chemical, kinematic, structural, and spatial properties. There is significant overlap in the distributions of these properties, especially so at higher metallicities. Distinguishing between these major structural components is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of the Galaxy. Multiple selection methods exist to classify stars as thin or thick disc stars, each with its own advantages and limitations. Aims: We investigate how different classification methods for categorising stars into the thick and thin disc populations influence the determination of structural properties of the two discs. Methods: We apply five different selection methods. Two methods use cuts in the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] and [Mg/Mn]-[Al/Fe] planes; one uses a dynamical separation in $J_\phi$ -$J_Z$ space; one uses an age-based cut; and the last one uses a kinematic likelihood method. For each method, we derive relative density profiles of each component as functions of height above the Galactic plane and Galactocentric radius, and fit these to a simple two-exponential disc model. We use red giant stars from APOGEE DR17 and stellar ages from astroNN. Results: Methods based on abundance or age data produce the cleanest separations, while kinematic and dynamical methods suffer higher contamination due to difficulties in separating well-mixed populations. The thin disc scale heights show a clear flaring as they increase with radius, while the thick disc stays approximately constant at around 1 kpc over most radii for all methods. All methods find the thin disc to have a longer scale length than the thick disc, with the difference being greatest for the chemical selection methods. A scale length of the thick disc of 2.0 kpc leads to one of between 2.3 and 3.0 kpc for the thin disc.
#### Estimating accretion times of halo substructures in the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 To unravel the formation history of the Milky Way, we estimate the accretion times of six phase-space substructures in the stellar halo, using the orbital frequencies toward two spatial directions ($r, \phi$) in spherical coordinates. These substructures, identified in our previous studies, are located in the solar neighbourhood and therefore have high-precision astrometry from Gaia. The uncertainties of the results are determined using the Monte Carlo method, and the significance is established through comparison with random halo samples. The results for the substructure GL-1 in both directions show good consistency and high significance ($4.4\sigma$ and $4.5\sigma$), yielding a combined accretion time of $5.59^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ Gyr ago. The substructures GL-4 and GR-1, with smaller pericenters, exhibit higher significance in the less massive potential of the Milky Way, implying that the more massive potential may overestimate the central mass, especially the bulge. The accretion times of GL-4 and GR-1 are $4.0 \pm 0.2$ Gyr with a confidence of $3.3\sigma$, and $2.3 \pm 0.1$ Gyr with a confidence of $3.7\sigma$, respectively. Further constraints on the accretion times of phase-space substructures require more precise astrometric data, e.g., by Gaia DR4, China Space Station Survey Telescope and Roman space telescope.
#### How much can we learn from resolved stellar kinematics of galactic haloes using action-based dynamical models?

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical models are used to study dark matter (DM) in galaxies, how galaxies assemble through mergers, and to test galaxy formation models. Despite its widespread use, there has been no systematic study quantifying how much information can be obtained from just two on-sky positions and line-of-sight velocities, which are typically available for nearby external galaxies. In this work, we introduce axisymmetric, action-based dynamical models that use the positions and velocities of stellar halo stars to jointly constrain the total mass distribution of galaxies and the underlying DM component, as well as the stellar halo phase-space distribution. We rigorously test the method using both idealised equilibrium galaxy mocks and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the Auriga suite, systematically assessing how its performance degrades as the available phase-space information is progressively reduced. We further examine the impact of galaxy inclination, modelling assumptions, and methodological systematics on the recovered mass profiles. A crucial development in this work is the improved marginalisation of the model likelihood over missing phase-space dimensions. Our models successfully recover the total and DM mass distributions, as well as the kinematic properties of the stellar tracers, within the derived confidence intervals. However, we find that with limited (3D or 4D) phase-space information, the flattening of the DM halo cannot be constrained with any degree of certainty. Nevertheless, the recovered mass profile is insensitive to the flattening. This finding is independently validated by Schwarzschild modelling tests.
#### VELOCE III. Reconstructing Radial Velocity Curves of Classical Cepheids

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel framework for accurately reconstructing radial velocity (RV) curves of classical Cepheids (Cepheids) from sparsely sampled time-series data suitable for application in large spectroscopic surveys. The framework provides a set of priors for the principal components of RV curves established based on high-precision measurements from the VELOCE project; template RV curves of Cepheids can be readily extracted from our results. We demonstrate the ability of our framework to estimate unbiased pulsation average velocities, $v_\gamma$, to within $20-30$m/s, and peak-to-peak amplitudes, $P2P$, to within $\sim 2\%$. Subsampling the initial data set, we show that $v_\gamma$ and $P2P$ can be determined to within $\sim 0.35$ km/s and $\sim 6-7\%$, respectively, from as few as three observations. We fitted existing time-series RV data of Cepheids in the LMC and SMC using this framework and obtained typical RMSE of $0.5-2.0$ km/s. The typical total uncertainty on $v_\gamma$ achieved for the SMC Cepheids is $\sim 0.85$ km/s, providing sensitivity to spectroscopic binaries (SB). We identified 8 SB1 systems; two and one of which are new detections in the LMC and SMC, respectively. This yields a single-lined SB fraction of $\sim 25\%$ and $29\%$ in the two galaxies, similar to the Milky Way's SB fraction of $29\%$ established as part of VELOCE. Despite their relatively small number, LMC Cepheids reproduce the known line-of-sight component of the LMC's large-scale rotation, which differs in the extremes by more than $80$km/s. The kinematics of the SMC are more complex and not sufficiently sampled by the available Cepheids. Our framework is designed to yield accurate $v_\gamma$ and $P2P$ of Cepheids observed by large spectroscopic surveys, such as 4MOST, SDSS-V, and others, and will unlock new insights into the kinematics and multiplicity of evolved intermediate-mass stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Microquasars have emerged as promising candidates to explain the cosmic-ray flux at petaelectronvolt energies. LHAASO observations revealed V4641~Sgr as the most extreme example so far. Using $\approx$100~h of H.E.S.S. data, we performed a spectro-morphological study of the gamma-ray emission around V4641~Sgr. We employed HI and dedicated CO observations of the region to infer the target material for cosmic-ray interactions. We detected multi-TeV emission around V4641~Sgr with a high significance. The emission region is elongated. We found a power-law spectrum with an index $\approx$1.8, and together with results from other gamma-ray instruments, this reveals a spectral energy distribution that peaks at energies of $\approx$100~TeV for the first time. We found indications (3$\sigma$) of a two-component morphology, with indistinguishable spectral properties. The position of V4641~Sgr is inconsistent with the best-fit position of the single-component model and with the dip between the two components. We found no significant evidence of an energy-dependent morphology. No dense gas was found at any distance towards V4641~Sgr. The peak of the SED at $\approx$100~TeV identifies V4641~Sgr as a candidate cosmic-ray accelerator beyond the so-called knee. The absence of dense target gas places stringent energetic constraints on hadronic interpretations, however. The H.E.S.S. measurement requires an unusually hard ($\approx 1.5$) spectral index for the protons. A leptonic scenario faces fewer obstacles if the particle transport is fast enough to avoid losses and to reproduce the observed energy-independent morphology. The absence of bright \xray emission across the gamma-ray emission region requires a magnetic field strength $\lesssim3$~$\mu$G, however. Our findings favour a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission. This conclusion does not exclude hadron acceleration in the V4641~Sgr system.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the extremely high-resolution ($m_{\rm bary}=4\rm{M}_\odot$) LYRA cosmological galaxy formation simulations of six dwarf galaxies with $M_{\rm 200c}\sim10^9\rm{M}_\odot$ at $z=0$ to investigate their stellar assembly histories. Based on the age of stars in these galaxies at $z=0$, $40-100\%$ of their stellar mass was formed by the time of reionization, when star formation (SF) abruptly shuts down. Depending on their halo mass evolution, some of the dwarfs reignite SF post-reionization (rejuvenators), while others remain quenched for the rest of cosmic time (reionization relics). However, the stellar mass of relics can still grow by more than $50\%$ through mergers post-reionisation. We find clear correlations between metallicity distributions of the galaxies and the fraction of stars formed post-reionization ($f_{\rm post-reio}^\star$) such that relics have lower median $\rm [Fe/H]$ with a more prominent low metallicity tail. Moreover, the shape of the galaxies at $z=0$ correlates with their $f_{\rm post-reio}^\star$, with rejuvenators showing more spherical stellar distribution than relics. This difference arises only post-reionization when rejuvenators become rounder with more SF activity. Similarly, the shape of dark matter (DM) halos in the inner regions display more spherical distributions in rejuvenators than in relics. The shape evolution shows that DM haloes in all galaxy formation simulations become rounder in comparison to their collision-less, DM-only counterparts. However, DM haloes of rejuvenators evolve more significantly. We do not find any correlation between SF activity and formation of shallow DM density cores in these galaxies. These predictions can be tested using upcoming observational data. In particular, our results indicate that the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation in the low mass regime is correlated with SF histories and the shape of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming weak-lensing surveys will probe the matter distribution at a few percent level on nonlinear scales (k > 1 h/Mpc) where baryonic feedback from galaxy formation modifies the clustering of matter. Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we quantify the mass and radial dependence of baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum by selectively replacing halos in the collisionless run with their full-physics counterparts. We find that group-scale halos with log $M_{200m}/h^{-1} M_{sun}$ in [13, 14] dominate the suppression, contributing a large fraction of the total reduction in power at k ~ 5-30 h/Mpc. The suppression is smaller on either side of this mass bin. Correctly reproducing the full suppression of the power spectrum requires accounting for matter redistribution (while enforcing mass conservation) beyond the virial radius of each halo. Crucially, the same group-scale regime produces the strongest and most detectable deviations in group-galaxy lensing, making stacked group lensing a powerful observational test of feedback models. Our results motivate emulators that jointly predict the matter power spectrum and halo-matter correlations including baryonic effects, enabling unbiased cosmological inference from small scales.
