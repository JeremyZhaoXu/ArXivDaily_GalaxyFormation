#### Threading the Magellanic Needle: Hypervelocity Stars Trace the Past Location of the LMC

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries have shown that a population of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) originate from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use three such HVSs as dynamical tracers to constrain the past orbit of the LMC. Since each star was ejected at a finite time in the past, it must intersect the past position of the LMC's central black hole at its ejection time. We model the LMC's orbit under the influence of dynamical friction and extended mass distributions for both the LMC and the Milky Way, generating a large ensemble of orbital realizations. By evaluating which orbits intersect the back-integrated HVS trajectories, we compute posterior distributions over the LMC's orbital history. This approach provides significantly tighter constraints on the past motion of the LMC than previously possible. We find two previously published orbital models that are consistent with these new constraints: a first-passage trajectory from a self-consistent hydrodynamic simulation, and a second-passage trajectory from a collisionless N-body simulation. In parallel, we infer the present-day ejection site of the HVSs -- likely tracing the LMC's dynamical center and supermassive black hole -- independent of conventional methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We use constrained idealized simulations of the LMC/Milky Way interaction to determine if the size of the LMC's gaseous halo (Corona) can be used to distinguish between first and second passage models $-$ an orbital trajectory for the LMC in which it has just recently approached the Milky Way for the first time (first passage), or one in which it has had a previous pericenter (second passage). Using live circumgalactic gas particles combined with analytic dark matter potentials evolved to follow previously published orbital trajectories, we find that the first passage model is able to reproduce the observed velocity profile and column density profile of the present day LMC Corona. On the other hand, in a second passage scenario the longer interaction time leads to the velocities and column densities around the LMC at the present day being too low. Based on this observed velocity profile, recent works have found that the LMC's Corona has been truncated to 17$-$20 kpc, and we find truncation radii of $15.3\pm 0.9$ kpc and $7.6\pm 2.0$ kpc for the first and second passage models, respectively. Thus, based on the gas properties of the LMC's CGM at the present day, a second passage trajectory is disfavored.
#### Faint supernovae and hyper-runaway white-dwarfs from single He-detonation in double HeCO-white-dwarf mergers

 - **Abstract**
 We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of mergers between low-mass hybrid HeCO white dwarfs (WDs), offering new insights into the diversity of thermonuclear transients. Unlike previously studied mergers involving higher-mass HeCO WDs and CO WDs, where helium detonation often triggers core ignition, our simulations reveal incomplete helium shell detonations in comparable-mass, lower-mass WD pairs. The result is a faint, rapidly evolving transient driven by the ejection of intermediate-mass elements and radioactive isotopes such as $^{48}$Cr and $^{52}$Fe, without significant $^{56}$Ni production. These transients may be detectable in upcoming wide-field surveys and could account for a subset of faint thermonuclear supernovae. Long-term evolution of the merger remnant shows that high-velocity PG-1159-type stars might be formed through this scenario, similar to normal CO-CO white dwarf mergers. This work expands our understanding of white dwarf mergers and their implications for nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are rare extragalactic events of unknown origin. Tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black holes, mergers of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars, and failed supernovae are among the suggestions. In this paper, we explore the viability of very massive star core-collapse events as the origin of LFBOTs. The appeal of such a model is that the formation of massive black holes via core collapse may yield observational signatures that can match the disparate lines of evidence that point towards both core-collapse and tidal disruption origins for LFBOTs. We explore the formation rate of massive black holes in population synthesis models, and compare the metallicities of their progenitors with the observed metallicities of LFBOT host galaxies. We further examine the composition, mass loss rates and fallback masses of these stars, placing them in the context of LFBOT observations. The formation rate of black holes with mass greater than ~30-40Msol is similar to the observed LFBOT rate. The stars producing these black holes are biased to low metallicity (Z<0.3Zsol), are H and He-poor and have dense circumstellar media. However, some LFBOTs have host galaxies with higher metallicities than predicted, and others have denser environments (plausibly due to late mass loss not captured in the models). We find that long-lived emission from an accretion disc (as implicated in the prototypical LFBOT AT2018cow) can plausibly be produced in these events. We conclude that (very) massive star core-collapse is a plausible explanation for LFBOTs. The preferred progenitors for LFBOTs in this scenario overlap with those predicted to produce super-kilonovae. We therefore suggest that LFBOTs are promising targets to search for super-kilonovae, and that they may contribute non-negligibly to the r-process enrichment of galaxies.
#### Inferring the dark matter distribution of massive galaxy clusters from deep optical observations: insights from the TNG300 simulation

 - **Abstract**
 Extragalactic stars within galaxy clusters contribute to the intracluster light (ICL), which is thought to be a promising tracer of the underlying dark matter (DM) distribution. In this study, we employ the TNG300 simulation to investigate the prospect of recovering the dark matter distribution of galaxy clusters from deep, wide-field optical images. For this, we generate mock observations of 40 massive clusters ($M_{200}\gtrsim 10^{14.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) at $z=0.06$ for the $g'$ band of the Wendelstein Wide-Field Imager (WWFI), and isolate the emission from the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the ICL by masking the satellite galaxies, following observational procedures. By comparing $\Sigma_{\rm BCG+ICL}$ profiles from these images against $\Sigma_{\rm DM}$ profiles for the central subhaloes, we find that $\Sigma_{\rm cen-DM}/\Sigma_{\rm BCG+ICL}$ exhibits a quasi-linear scaling relation in log space with the normalised distance $r/R_{\Delta}$, for both $R_{\Delta}=R_{200}$ and $R_{500}$. The scatter in the scaling is predominantly stochastic, showing a weak dependence on formation time and dynamical state. We recover the DM concentration and mass within $\approx 23$ and $\approx 15$ per cent of their true values (for $R_{200}$), respectively, and with $\approx 3$ per cent larger uncertainties for $R_{500}$. Alternatively, we find that the concentration can be estimated using the BCG+ICL fraction, the central's DM mass using the BCG+ICL flux, and the total DM mass using the bolometric flux. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deriving dark matter characteristics of galaxy clusters to be observed with facilities like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Mergers are believed to play a pivotal role in galaxy evolution, and measuring the galaxy merger fraction is a longstanding goal of both observational and theoretical studies. In this work, we extend the consideration of the merger fraction from the standard measure of binary mergers, namely those comprising two merging galaxies, to multiple mergers, namely mergers involving three or more galaxies. We use the Illustris and IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to provide a theoretical prediction for the fraction of galaxy systems that are involved in a multiple merger as a function of various parameters, with a focus on the relationship between the multiple merger fraction $f_m$ and the total merger fraction $f_t$. We generally find that binary mergers dominate the total fraction and that $f_m\approx (0.5-0.7)f_t^{5/3}$, a prediction that can be tested observationally. We further compare the empirical simulation results with toy models where mergers occur, on the evolution timeline of a galaxy, either at constant intervals or as a Poisson process at a constant rate. From these comparisons, where the toy models typically produce lower multiple merger fractions, we conclude that in cosmological simulations, mergers are more strongly clustered in time than in these toy scenarios, likely reflecting the hierarchical nature of cosmological structure formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of massive galaxies at ages below 1 Gyr pose a challenge to standard models of galaxy formation, which predict significantly longer assembly timescales. One possible explanation is that active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive large scale outflows that accelerate galaxy growth. To test this scenario in the local Universe, we analyzed Gaia DR3 data for stars within 5 kpc of the Galactic center, computing galactocentric radial velocities (v_radial_gc) in 27 spatial sectors covering the entire Galaxy, with radial binning of 0.25 kpc. Coordinate transformations and velocity calculations were performed using the Astropy library. We find that 21 of 27 sectors exhibit statistically significant outward motions of 3-50 km/s, while one quadrant shows negative velocities, likely related to the configuration of an activity zone and/or the Galactic bar. Both disk and halo populations also display small but significant mean expansion of 3-9 km/s (p<0.01). These results are consistent with our previous studies, where globular clusters showed outward velocities of 17-31 km/s up to 12 kpc, and axisymmetric analyses of Gaia DR3 stars indicated expansion of ~19 km/s to 5 kpc. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the Milky Way exhibits measurable central expansion, potentially reflecting AGN-driven feedback. This interpretation departs from standard theory and should be regarded as preliminary, requiring further study. However, if confirmed, such expansion could provide a natural explanation for the rapid appearance of massive galaxies observed by JWST.
#### Azimuthal Misalignments in Stellar Warp Structure as Dynamical Tracers of Mergers in Milky Way-like Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the origin of warps in stellar disks using high-resolution Milky Way analogs from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. Focusing on galaxies that experienced a major merger, we identify a characteristic azimuthal misalignment between the warp structures of stellar populations formed before and after the merger. This misalignment persists even after correcting for differential rotation, suggesting it is a dynamical imprint of the merger rather than a consequence of internal kinematics. In contrast, galaxies without significant merger events show no such offset between stellar populations of different ages. These findings support the scenario in which mergers can induce long-lived warps and leave detectable structural signatures in stellar disks. Applied to the Milky Way, this approach offers a potential way to test whether the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger contributed to the formation of the Galactic warp. It may also provide an independent means to constrain the timing of such merger events by examining the phase offsets in the stellar warp as a function of stellar age.
#### Analysis of Galaxies at the Extremes: Failed Galaxy Progenitors in the MAGNETICUM Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 There is increasing observational evidence for a failed galaxy formation pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.
#### High energy gamma-ray sources in the VVV survey - III. Spectroscopic confirmation of an AGN at low Galactic latitudes

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to spectroscopically confirm the nature of VVV-J181258.71-314346.7, a candidate counterpart to the unassociated gamma-ray source 4FGLJ1812.8-3144. This object was selected based on its near-infrared photometric properties and moderate variability, as part of a broader effort to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN) behind the Galactic bulge and disc. We obtained near-infrared spectra using the Flamingos-2 instrument at Gemini South, covering the $1.1 $--$ 1.8~\mu$m range with a spectral resolution of $R \sim 1200$. Standard data reduction procedures were applied, including telluric correction and wavelength calibration. The analysis focused on the identification of emission lines and the estimation of the redshift using cross-correlation techniques and spectral template fitting. Despite a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, the spectrum reveals the presence of Pa$\beta$ and Fe\,\textsc{ii} emission lines. The measured redshift is $z = 0.206 \pm 0.001$, which confirms the extragalactic nature of the source. The spectral features such as line ratios and full width at half maximum are consistent with those typically observed in type-1 AGNs, particularly Seyfert 1 galaxies. This study demonstrates the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy to reveal AGNs that are obscured by highly extincted and crowded galactic fields. The confirmation of an AGN at low Galactic latitude ($b\sim -6.5$°) shows that near-IR surveys like VVV can successfully penetrate the zone of avoidance. Extending this approach to additional candidates is crucial for improving the census of AGNs hidden behind the Milky Way, as well as for constraining the population of unassociated gamma-ray sources in these troublesome regions.
#### Suzaku observations of outskirts of nearby clusters and groups: I. electron density and gas fraction to the virial radius

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of Suzaku observations of 14 nearby galaxy clusters and groups (z < 0.06), extending radial coverage out to the virial radius (approximately r200). The sample spans a wide mass range, from M500 about 2x10^13 to 7x10^14 solar masses, and includes well-studied systems such as Coma, Perseus, and Virgo. We carefully modeled all background components, including the soft X-ray foregrounds (the Local Hot Bubble, Milky Way Halo, and super-virial temperature components), the cosmic X-ray background, and the non-X-ray background, and assessed their effects on the derived properties of the intracluster medium (ICM). We constructed radial profiles of emission measure, electron density, and temperature. Temperatures decrease smoothly with radius, typically dropping to about one-third to half of their peak values near r200. For relaxed clusters, the emission measure profiles outside the core regions are well described by a beta model with beta around 0.6-0.7, while groups show slightly flatter slopes of beta around 0.4-0.65. Beyond r2500, electron density profiles follow a power-law decline with a slope close to 2. At r500 and r200, the electron density and the gas mass fraction show a tight correlation with the system mass, except for three clusters with bright subclusters. In massive clusters, the gas fraction increases with radius and approaches the cosmic baryon fraction near r200. In contrast, lower-mass systems exhibit gas fractions of around 0.1 at r200. The observed mass dependence of gas fractions suggests that feedback and related processes play an increasingly important role toward the group scale, shaping the connection between baryons and dark matter halos.

 These notes review theoretical models of massive black hole formation, growth and observables. They start with a brief summary of basic properties of massive black hole properties. The current view on massive black holes and active galactic nuclei at high redshift is then summarized, highlighting the JWST ``revolution'' and the questions raised by the recent observations. The notes then touch on massive black hole formation and growth mechanisms, emphasizing the processes at play at early cosmic times. Then techniques for modeling the cosmic massive black hole evolution, are reviewed with an emphasis on cosmological simulations, before approaching how observables are derived from models. They conclude with a section reflecting on the main questions on the JWST-discovered population in light of the material presented in the earlier sections.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decades, there has been growing observational and theoretical evidence that cosmic-ray-induced instabilities play an important role in both acceleration and transport of cosmic rays (CRs). For instance, the efficient acceleration of charged particles at supernova remnant shocks requires rapidly growing instabilities, so much so that none of the proposed processes seem sufficient to warrant acceleration to PeV energies. In this work, we investigate whether an acoustic instability triggered by the presence of a CR pressure gradient can lead to significant self-confinement of charged particles in the vicinity of shocks. We validate the expected growth rates and obtain the scale and energy of magnetic field perturbations induced by such system using magnetohydrodynamical simulations. Our results suggest a strong suppression of the diffusion coefficient for particles with Larmor radius around a thousandth of the precursor scale length.
#### Quasi-Periodic Pulsations Driven by Structural Oscillations in a Kink-Unstable Flaring Coronal Loop

 - **Abstract**
 Twisted coronal loops in the solar atmosphere may become kink-unstable when their magnetic field lines are sufficiently twisted. This instability can trigger magnetic reconnection, leading to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, which manifests as a solar flare. Previous research has demonstrated that oscillations in microwave emissions, resembling observed quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), can be generated by the reconnecting loop. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between the oscillations of the loop and these microwave pulsations. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we examine two models: a straight loop in a uniform-density atmosphere and a curved loop in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. Using new methodology, we extract the reconnecting loop-top from both models and identify structural oscillations. We then compare these oscillations with the gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation emitted from the simulations, which is forward-modelled using a radiative transfer code. We find that oscillations in the GS emissions are driven by sausage and kink-mode oscillations. However, the relationship between the oscillation frequencies of the GS emission and the identified loop oscillation modes is complex. The dominant mode in the former may result from interference between sausage-mode and kink-mode oscillations or entirely different mechanisms. Results such as these increase our understanding of the time-dependent behaviour of solar flares and lay the groundwork for potential diagnostic tools that could be used to determine physical parameters within a flaring loop
#### The Milky Way - Large Magellanic Cloud Interaction with Simulation Based Inference

 - **Abstract**
 The infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into the Milky Way (MW) has displaced the MW's centre of mass, manifesting as an observed reflex motion in the velocities of outer halo stars. We use a Simulation Based Inference framework to constrain properties of the MW, LMC and the induced reflex motion using the dynamics of outer MW halo stars. Specifically, we use the mean radial and tangential velocities of outer halo stars calculated in a set of distance and on-sky bins. We train neural networks to estimate parameter posterior distributions using a set of $128,000$ rigid MW--LMC simulations conditioned upon velocity data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the combined H3+SEGUE+MagE outer halo surveys. We constrain the reflex motion velocity and the enclosed MW and LMC masses within $50 \, \rm kpc$ using the DESI or H3+SEGUE+MagE dataset while varying the survey sky coverage and depth. We find the most precise constraints by using the radial and tangential velocity data from the H3+SEGUE+MagE survey and on-sky quadrant sky coverages. We report a reflex motion velocity, the speed at which the MW lurches towards the LMC, of $v_{\rm{travel}} = 26.4^{+5.5}_{-4.4} \, \rm km \, \rm s^{-1}$, while simultaneously finding an enclosed LMC mass of $M_{\rm LMC}(< 50 \, \rm kpc) = 9.2^{+1.9}_{-2.3} \times 10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$ and enclosed MW mass of $M_{\rm MW}(< 50 \, \rm kpc) = 4.4^{+0.7}_{-0.7} \times 10^{11}\, \rm M_{\odot}$. Our results suggest that the LMC's total mass is at least $\approx 10-15 \%$ of that of the MW. This inference framework is flexible such that it can provide rapid and reliable constraints when applied to any future survey measuring the velocities of outer halo stars.

 - **Abstract**
 When debris from a star that experienced a tidal disruption events (TDE) after passing too close to a massive black hole returns to pericenter on the second passage, it is compressed, leading to the formation of nozzle shocks (in the orbital plane) and pancake shocks (perpendicular to the orbital plane). Resolving these shocks is a long-standing problem in the hydrodynamic simulations of parabolic TDEs. Excessive numerical energy dissipation or heating unrealistically expands the stream. In this Letter, we apply adaptive particle refinement to our 3D general relativistic smoothed particle simulations to locally increase the resolution near the pericenter. We achieve resolutions equivalent to $6.55\times10^{11}$ particles, allowing us to converge on the true energy dissipation. We conclude that only $4\times10^{-5}$ of the orbital energy is dissipated in nozzle shocks for a Sun-like star tidally disrupted by a $10^6$ solar-mass black hole, therefore the nozzle shocks are unlikely to be important in the evolution of TDEs.

 S$H_0$ES 2016-2022 $HVI$ data for classical Cepheids in the keystone galaxy NGC4258 yield doubly discordant Wesenheit Leavitt functions:~$\Delta W_{0,H-VI} = -0.13\pm0^{m}.02$ ($-0^{m}.17$ unweighted) and that is paired with a previously noted $\Delta W_{0,I-VI}\simeq-0^{m}.3$, which in concert with complimentary evidence suggest the 2016 S$H_0$ES NGC4258-anchored $H_0 \pm \sigma_{H_0}$ warrants scrutiny (i.e., $\sigma_{H_0}/{H_0}\gtrsim 6$\%). Cepheid distance uncertainties are further exacerbated by extinction law ambiguities endemic to such Leavitt relations (e.g., NGC4258), particularly for comparatively obscured variables (e.g., $\Delta d \gtrsim 4$\%, reddened Cepheid subsamples in the Milky Way, M31, NGC2442, NGC4424, NGC5643, NGC7250). Lastly, during the analysis it was identified that the 2022 S$H_0$ES database relays incorrect SMC Cepheid photometry.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the impact of warm dark matter (WDM) particle mass on galaxy properties using 1,024 state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the DREAMS project. We begin by using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) coupled with a normalizing flow to explore global statistical descriptors of galaxy populations, such as the mean, standard deviation, and histograms of 14 galaxy properties. We find that subhalo gas mass is the most informative feature for constraining the WDM mass, achieving a determination coefficient of R^2 = 0.9. We employ symbolic regression to extract simple, interpretable relations with the WDM particle mass. Finally, we adopt a more localized approach by selecting individual dark matter halos and using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a normalizing flow to infer the WDM mass, incorporating subhalo properties as node features and global simulation statistics as graph-level features. The GNN approach yields only a residual improvement over MLP models based solely on global features, indicating that most of the predictive power resides in the global descriptors, with only marginal gains from halo-level information.
