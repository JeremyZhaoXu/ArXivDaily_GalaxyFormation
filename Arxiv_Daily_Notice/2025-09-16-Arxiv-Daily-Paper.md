 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 is the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected to date by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. With at least one black hole (BH) in the upper-mass gap and both BHs exhibiting high spins ($\chi_{1,2} \gtrsim 0.8$), this event challenges standard isolated binary evolution models. A compelling alternative is a dynamical origin in star clusters, where stellar binaries and hierarchical mergers may both contribute to the formation of similar BBHs. In this work, we investigate the formation of GW231123-like events in different cluster environments using the B-POP semi-analytic population synthesis code. We find that low-metallicity environments ($Z \lesssim 0.002$) are ideal for producing BBH mergers similar to GW231123. In young and globular clusters, these BBHs have components formed in stellar binaries, whilst in nuclear clusters there is also a significant contribution from BHs built-up via hierarchical mergers. Natal spins of BHs formed in stellar binaries are crucial to find GW231123 analogs. In particular, our models suggest that BHs from stellar binaries are likely characterized by high-spins. Simulated GW231123-like systems exhibit short delay times, $t_\mathrm{del} \sim 0.1 - 1$ Gyr, which suggests their progenitors formed close to the inferred merger redshift ($z = 0.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$). We argue that star clusters in metal-poor dwarf galaxies or Milky Way-like galaxies are ideal nurseries, inferring an upper limit to the local merger rate of $\mathcal{R} \sim 1.6\times10^{-3} - 0.16$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for nuclear clusters, $\sim 0.036 - 0.72$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for globular clusters, and $4\times10^{-4}-0.041$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for young clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Every large galaxy has a black hole in its center. The interaction between the black hole and their host profoundly shapes galactic evolution and the Universe as a whole. The key feature of this interaction are black hole jets - or more generally winds - which every black hole must have. Despite our Galaxy's central black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), proximity and importance, the active wind from it has eluded scientists for over half a century. Here we report the discovery of a large active wind from Sgr A* using unprecedentedly deep observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). We detect a large conical clearing in the cold molecular gas surrounding Sgr A* that is at least 1 parsec in length and has a 45-degree opening angle. The morphology and energetics of this structure are consistent with active clearing by a hot wind from Sgr A*. This finding resolves the long-standing mystery of the missing wind from Sgr A*, and delivers the most detailed look yet of black hole feeding and feedback processes in our Galactic center.
#### Formation of Cosmic Noon Protogalaxies via Quasar-Induced Fragmentation of a Cosmic Filament

 - **Abstract**
 When black hole jets encounter ambient medium, they can compress the gas, trigger star formation, and create stellar clusters containing tens of thousands of stars. Here, we report a remarkable discovery of such a phenomenon that happened just 2.2 billion years after the Big Bang, during the Cosmic Noon era. Quasar SDSSJ141924.44+532315.5, powered by a one-billion-solar-mass black hole, is seen blasting a powerful jet that interacts with a hypermassive gas reservoir, creating a fascinating, clumpy, arc- like structure spanning over 250 kiloparsecs in projected length, consisting of at least eight clumps. Each clump contains billions of stars, is as massive as the Milky Way, and exhibits extreme levels of star formation. We interpret these findings as fragmentation of a cosmic filament triggered by a jet overpressurized expanding cocoon, which leads to the birth of protogalaxies, a process observed at scales never seen before. We find that the physical conditions within the filament are favorable for a fragmentation scenario to occur. We also discuss the survivability and evolution of individual clumps in the context of unsolved galaxy formation theory problems.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed massive, evolved galaxies only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, challenging standard cosmological models. To test the hypothesis that the Galactic nucleus may act as a source of matter and energy capable of accelerating galaxy formation, we examined whether the Milky Way itself shows signs of central activity. Expansion of the Galactic center would imply such activity in its nuclear region. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed stellar motions along the south north axis of the Galaxy using Gaia DR3 data. Average Galactocentric radial velocities were computed in 50 control points, spaced by 0.1 kpc with a sampling radius of 0.05 kpc, up to 5 kpc from the Galactic center. The results show a strong symmetry: in the northern region, 36 of 50 points have positive velocities, with an average of 19.15 +/- 10.80 km/s (N = 50), while in the southern region, 37 of 50 points have negative velocities, with an average of - 19.24 +/- 8.22 km/s (N = 50). A Students t test confirms that the two distributions differ significantly (0.003). The combination of positive average velocities in the north and negative average velocities in the south indicates a symmetric outflow of stars away from the Galactic center, consistent with expansion in its central region. These Galactocentric radial velocities are consistent with the formation of massive, evolved galaxies within 300 My, as observed by JWST. If extended to other galaxies, the results (together with earlier findings on globular cluster motions) suggest that aspects of standard galaxy formation models may require refinement. This interpretation, however, remains preliminary and requires further study.
#### The Signature of Sub-galactic Dark Matter Clumping in the Global 21-cm Signal of Hydrogen

 - **Abstract**
 It is thought that the Universe went through an early period known as the Dark Ages, during which primeval density fluctuations grew to form the first luminous objects, marking the beginning of Cosmic Dawn around 100 million years after the Big Bang. The 21-cm line of hydrogen atoms is the most promising probe of these epochs, with extensive observational efforts underway. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to precisely calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm radio intensity. We show that it presents a potential opportunity to probe the properties of dark matter in a new regime, corresponding to a length-scale of only 150,000 light years and a mass-scale of 20 million Solar masses. This effect can in principle be detected unambiguously during the Dark Ages, where the weak signal requires an array of global signal antennae. During Cosmic Dawn, when stellar radiation boosts the signal, a single global antenna suffices, but the clumping effect must then be separated from the effect of the stars. Our findings open new avenues for testing the nature of dark matter as well as non-standard cosmological models.
#### Probing small-scale dark matter clumping with the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm line of hydrogen is the most promising probe of the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum, focusing on redshifts $z=20-40$. As the clumping effect arises from small-scale density fluctuations, it offers a unique opportunity to probe the standard cold dark matter model in a new regime and thus potentially investigate the properties of dark matter. To this end, we also study a warm dark matter $-$ like model with a Gaussian cutoff on a scale of 50 kpc. We find that clumping has a significant impact on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum. For example, for the Dark Ages case at $z=30$ and wavenumber $k=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$, small-scale clustering enhances the 21-cm power spectrum by $13\%$. Once Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling kicks in due to the first stars, the 21-cm signal strengthens, and the effect of clumping grows; it suppresses the observable power spectrum at $z=20$ by a factor of two, while the cutoff model has less than half the clumping impact. The clumping effect is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) AA$^\star$ configuration, by up to a factor of 20 for standard cold dark matter, though detection will require separation from foregrounds and from astrophysical contributions to the 21-cm power spectrum.
#### Simulations of Tidal Disruption of Supernova in Galaxy Nuclear Region: A Novel Model for Ambiguous Nuclear Transients

 - **Abstract**
 An increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients, including some extreme nuclear transients, have been reported, which cannot be simply explained by the tidal disruption event (TDE) due to their high energy and/or overmassive black holes. Stars that form in or are captured by AGN disks will grow and migrate inward, potentially exploding as supernovae once the inner cold accretion disk disappears during the phase of AGN decay. We propose that tidal disruption of a supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear transients that are even more luminous than typical TDEs and are not limited by the SMBH mass. In this scenario, the SMBH can capture the supernova ejecta, which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington limit for SMBHs with $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$, while it remains sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity \(\gtrsim10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}\) in galaxies with $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{8}\,M_\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping is emerging as a new probe of faint galaxies consisting the cosmic web that elude traditional surveys. However, the resonant nature of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer complicates the interpretation of observed data. In this study, we develop a fast and accurate analytic prescription for computing the Ly$\alpha$ intensity field on Mpc scales in the post-reionization Universe. Motivated by insights from Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) experiments, we exploit the fact that in a highly ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) with negligible damping-wing opacity, cosmological redshifting quickly drives Ly$\alpha$ photons out of resonance, terminating the scattering process and simplifying their large-scale behavior. Photons emitted blueward of the Ly$\alpha$ line center tend to scatter on a thin, nearly spherical surface of last scattering, with a radius determined by the redshifting distance to resonance. Based on this behavior, we derive closed-form expressions for the scattered emissivity and projected surface brightness that depend only on the source spectrum, the HI density, and the peculiar velocity field. When applied to a source in a realistically simulated IGM at $z = 3$, our model shows mild discrepancies with MCRT results within a physical Mpc of the host halo, where strong gravitational infall redistributes the scattered photons, but achieves better than 5% accuracy beyond that distance in both raw and cumulative surface brightness. Our prescription offers a computationally efficient alternative to MCRT for forward-modeling Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps from cosmological simulations, enabling the inference of underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters from future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties such as $(u-r)\,$colour, stellar mass, star formation rate, and stellar metallicity, using a stellar mass-matched sample of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) to quantify correlations among galaxy properties and apply Student's t-test to assess the statistical significance of their differences across cosmic web environments. In every case, the null hypothesis is rejected at $> 99.99\%$ confidence, providing strong evidence that correlations among galaxy properties are strongly dependent on cosmic web environments.
#### The Orbits of Isolated Dwarfs in the Local Group from New 3D Kinematics: Constraints on First Infall, Backsplash, and Quenching Mechanisms

 - **Abstract**
 It is commonly supposed that quenched field dwarfs near the edge of the Local Group (LG) are backsplash galaxies, having previously orbited within the Milky Way (MW) or M31's virial radius, whereas galaxies on first infall should still have gas and star formation. We measured proper motions (PMs) for six dwarf galaxies located 400-1000 kpc from the MW using the Hubble Space Telescope. For four galaxies (Aquarius, Cetus, Pisces, Tucana), we report the first PMs. For the remaining two (Leo T and Pegasus), we measure PMs with order-of-magnitude improvement. We compute orbital histories to assess whether any of the six are backsplash galaxies. While some have non-zero likelihoods of past interaction with the MW or M31, these are weak and typically occur at large distances (e.g., $>$ 2Rvir). The properties of Aquarius, Leo T, Pisces, and Pegasus are consistent with first passage through a massive halo. Cetus, which shows a low probability (~4-6%) of interacting with the MW or M31 in the last 6 Gyr, is more likely a backsplash galaxy resulting from an interaction with M31 over 6 Gyr ago, in the same regime where rigid orbital models become less reliable. Tucana has been thought to be a backsplash galaxy, but our orbits indicate it cannot have interacted with a massive LG host. Our results highlight the diversity of evolutionary pathways for isolated, intermediate-mass dwarfs ($M_* \approx 10^5-10^7 M_{\odot}$) and the need to reassess quenching mechanisms beyond environmental interactions with massive hosts.

 - **Abstract**
 Scaling relations between galactic parameters represent key pieces of evidence for investigating the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. In most studies, these relations have been obtained for large portions of the galaxies (i.e., on kpc scales), but it is also important to evaluate these relations in smaller scales. In this work, we used optical data cubes of a subsample of nearby galaxies of the DIVING 3D survey. These allowed us to analyze the scaling relations involving stellar velocity dispersion, stellar population age, and stellar population metallicity at the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of galaxies. We detected correlations between the stellar velocity dispersion and the age, metallicity, and total stellar mass. These correlations are independent of galaxy inclinations, considering all morphological types, nuclear activity, and the presence or absence of galactic bars. We detected, for the first time, a correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and stellar metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies. It is found to be qualitatively consistent with the well-known stellar mass-metallicity relation. We also noted that barred galaxies tend to show younger and less metal-rich stellar populations than unbarred galaxies in the central regions, which may be a consequence of the bar triggering star formation in the nuclear regions of these objects. Some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in our sample are positioned above the observed correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and stellar population age, suggesting that their nuclear stellar populations are younger than expected. This may be a consequence of positive AGN feedback, triggering star formation. Conversely, starburst galaxies do not show nuclear stellar populations at ages over one billion years.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise determination of galaxy cluster masses is crucial for establishing reliable mass-observable scaling relations in cluster cosmology. We employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate galaxy cluster masses from radially sampled profiles of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) inferred from X-ray observations. GNNs naturally handle inputs of variable length and resolution by representing each ICM profile as a graph, enabling accurate and flexible modeling across diverse observational conditions. We trained and tested GNN model using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred Project. The mass estimates using our method exhibit no systematic bias compared to the true cluster masses in the simulations. Additionally, we achieve a scatter in recovered mass versus true mass of about 6\%, which is a factor of six smaller than obtained from a standard hydrostatic equilibrium approach. Our algorithm is robust to both data quality and cluster morphology and it is capable of incorporating model uncertainties alongside observational uncertainties. Finally, we apply our technique to XMM-Newton observed galaxy cluster samples and compare the GNN derived mass estimates with those obtained with $Y_{\rm SZ}$-M$_{500}$ scaling relations. Our results provide strong evidence, at 5$\sigma$ level, for a mass-dependent bias in SZ derived masses, with higher mass clusters exhibiting a greater degree of deviation. Furthermore, we find the median bias to be $(1-b)=0.85_{-14}^{+34}$, albeit with significant dispersion due to its mass dependence. This work takes a significant step towards establishing unbiased observable mass scaling relations by integrating X-ray, SZ and optical datasets using deep learning techniques, thereby enhancing the role of galaxy clusters in precision cosmology.
