 - **Abstract**
 The identification of stellar structures in the Galactic halo, including stellar streams and merger remnants, often relies on the dynamics of their constituent stars. However, this approach has limitations due to the complex dynamical interactions between these structures and their environment. Perturbations such as tidal forces exerted by the Milky Way, the potential escape of stars, and passages through the Galactic plane can result in the loss of dynamical coherence of stars in these structures. Consequently, relying solely on dynamics may be insufficient for detecting such disrupted or dispersed remnants. We combine chemistry and dynamics, integrated through a system of neural networks, to develop a clustering method for identifying accreted structures in the Galactic halo. We developed an integrated approach combining Siamese neural networks (SNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), autoencoders, and the OPTICS algorithm to create a comprehensive procedure named CREEK. This method is designed to uncover stellar structures in the Galactic halo. Initially, CREEK was trained on known globular clusters (GCs) and then applied to the dataset to identify stellar streams. CREEK successfully recovered 80% of the GCs present in the APOGEE dataset, re-identified several known stellar streams, and identified a potential new stream. Additionally, within highly populated stellar structures, CREEK can identify substructures that exhibit distinct chemical compositions and orbital energies. This approach provides an objective data-driven method for selecting stars associated with streams and stellar structures in general.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) offer a unique probe of supermassive black hole (SMBH) demographics, but their observed rates remain difficult to reconcile with standard single-SMBH models. In this work, we use simulations of SMBH binaries, including the combined effects of eccentric Kozai-Lidov oscillations and two-body relaxation, to explore how TDE rates scale with SMBH mass and redshift. We find that binary systems exhibit increasing TDE rates with mass, in contrast to the declining trend expected for single SMBHs. These binary-driven rates match those observed in post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that a subset of TDE hosts may contain SMBH binaries. TDE light curves in some massive galaxies exhibit unexpectedly short durations, suggesting that the disrupting SMBH may be less massive than implied by host galaxy scaling relations, consistent with disruptions by the less massive black hole in a binary. By convolving our mass-dependent rates with the SMBH mass function, we predict redshift-dependent TDE rates, which we show can be used to constrain the supermassive black hole binary fraction. Our results provide a testable framework for interpreting TDE demographics in upcoming wide-field surveys such as LSST and Roman.
#### Evidence of .Ia Supernova Detonations in 3D Hydrodynamical Simulations of Double Degenerate Mergers

 - **Abstract**
 We report detailed 3D simulations of 1.1 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ Oxygen-Neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs) merging with a 0.35 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ helium WD, conducted with the moving-mesh hydrodynamic code AREPO. The simulations utilise self-consistent chemical profiles for the primary WD which were generated by a stellar evolution code incorporating the effects of semi-degenerate carbon burning. We find that a helium detonation is ignited at the base of the helium layer, starting a thermonuclear runaway which encircles the WD and ejects material as a sub-luminous supernovae. Our canonical simulation, (C-120), ejects 0.103 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ of primarily $^{4}\mathrm{He}$, $^{28}\mathrm{Si}$, and $^{32}\mathrm{S}$, after which the primary begins accreting again from the surviving secondary. Our results depend qualitatively on the "inspiral time" simulation parameter, which describes the length of a period of accelerated angular momentum loss. For example, the binary does not survive when inspiral time is too long. We compare the results using our self-consistent chemical profiles to a constant-composition WD structure and find the same explosion pattern when the inspiral time is short. However, we are able to obtain a typical Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) which destroys the primary by using the constant-composition structure and long inspiral. The shock-convergence in this simulation follows the "x-scissor mechanism" described by Gronow et al. in 2020, and causes a secondary detonation due to higher temperatures and higher number density of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at the convergence site. These results highlight the potential for unrealistic outcomes when conducting simulations that incorporate unrealistically large enhancements in angular momentum losses and (or) non-realistic chemical structures for the primary WD.
#### A thermonuclear supernova interacting with hydrogen- and helium-deficient circumstellar material. SN 2020aeuh as a SN Ia-CSM-C/O?

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae (Type Ia supernovae; SNe Ia) remains a key objective in contemporary astronomy. The rare subclass of SNe Ia that interacts with circumstellar material (Type Ia-CSM) allows for studies of the progenitor's environment before explosion, and generally favours single-degenerate progenitor channels. The case of SN Ia-CSM PTF11kx clearly connected thermonuclear explosions with hydrogen-rich CSM-interacting events, and the more recent SN 2020eyj connected SNe Ia with helum-rich companion progenitors. Here we present a study of SN 2020aeuh, a Type Ia-CSM with delayed interaction. We analyse photometric and spectroscopic data that monitor the evolution of SN 2020aeuh and compare its properties with those of peculiar SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe. At early times, the evolution of SN 2020aeuh resembles a slightly overluminous SN Ia. Later, the interaction-dominated spectra develop the same pseudocontinuum seen in Type Ia-CSM PTF11kx and SN 2020eyj. However, the later-time spectra of SN 2020aeuh lack hydrogen and helium narrow lines. Instead, a few narrow lines could be attributed to carbon and oxygen. We fit the pseudobolometric light curve with a CSM-interaction mode, yielding a CSM mass of 1-2 M$_{\odot}$. We propose that SN 2020aeuh was a Type Ia supernova that eventually interacted with a dense medium which was deficient in both hydrogen and helium. Whereas previous SNe Ia-CSM constitute our best evidence for nondegenerate companion progenitors, the CSM around SN 2020aeuh is more difficult to understand. We include a hydrodynamical simulation for a double-degenerate system to showcase how the dynamical evolution of such a progenitor scenario could produce the CSM observed around SN 2020aeuh. It is clear that SN 2020aeuh challenges current models for stellar evolution leading up to a SN Ia explosion.
#### A new type-1 transition in NGC 1346 revealed by (spectro)polarimetry

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first photo- and spectropolarimetric observations of the changing-look active galactic nucleus NGC~1346 taken with the Perkins telescope (November 2022, March 2025) and VLT/FORS2 (August and September 2024), which have revealed a new spectral transition. We find that NGC~1346 has reverted to its former (2001) type-1 spectral state after having been a type-2 active galactic nucleus from 2004 to 2022. More and more intense broad H$\beta$ (3720 $\pm$ 310 km.s$^{-1}$ full width at half maximum) and H$\alpha$ (2985 $\pm$ 230 km.s$^{-1}$) emission lines appeared between August and September 2024, suggesting that the broad-line region (BLR) is increasingly irradiated. The strong blueshift of the Balmer lines ($\sim$ 1600 km.s$^{-1}$) indicates that the gas is moving toward the observer, possibly due to a radiation-driven outflow. The strong difference between 2022's ($\sim$ 3\%) and 2024-2025's de-biased polarization ($\le$ 0.5\%), the blueing of the spectra between August and September 2024, and the slow rise in the integrated flux between 2022 and 2025 argue against asymmetric or temporary obscuration by a cloud passing in front of the line of sight. Two options, either a re-illumination of the BLR or a tidal disruption event, can explain the observed properties of NGC~1346. Timely follow-up observations taken while the phenomenon is still ongoing are needed to determine which of the two solutions is the correct one.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, ultraviolet (UV) extinction curves have been measured in M31 along thirteen new sightlines, increasing the M31 sample to seventeen. This sample covers a wide area of M31 having galactocentric distances of 5 to 16 kpc, enabling the analysis of UV extinction curve variations over a large region of an external galaxy similar to the Milky Way with global galactic characteristics such as metallicity for the first time. No correlation is found between the extinction parameters and galactocentric distance which might be expected if there is a radial metallicity gradient in M31. Most of the new UV extinction curves presented here are significantly different from the average extinction curves of the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC, but the average M31 extinction curve is similar to the average extinction curve in the 30-Dor region of the LMC. The wide range of extinction curves seen in each individual Local Group galaxy suggests that global galactic properties such as metallicity may be less important than the local environmental conditions such as density, UV radiation field, and shocks along each sightline. The combined behavior of the Milky Way, LMC, SMC, and now M31 UV extinction curves supports the idea that there is a family of curves in the Local Group with overlapping dust grain properties between different galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed spectroscopic study of ionised gas in the nearby (~3.3Mpc) dwarf galaxy NGC 2366, a local analogue of Green Pea galaxies, based on observations with the SCORPIO-2 instrument at the Russian 6-m BTA telescope. Using scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry and long-slit spectroscopy, we examine the gas kinematics, excitation mechanisms, and chemical abundances across the disc of NGC 2366, including its prominent starburst region Mrk 71 and the companion region NGC 2363. We identified 20 regions with locally elevated Ha velocity dispersion, only four of which correspond to known high-energy sources. We argue that one of the remaining objects can be a previously unidentified Wolf-Rayet star and two - supernova remnants. For 15 HII regions, we measure electron temperatures, oxygen and nitrogen abundances via the `direct' Te method, with 12 + log(O/H) ranging from 7.6 to 8.0 in most of the regions. We show that Mrk 71 has higher oxygen abundance compared to the other \HII regions in the galaxy, contrary to the previous indirect estimates suggesting flat gradient throughout the galaxy. Together with the localized spatial variations of metallicity in the area, it is indicative of metal enrichment by the outflow from the super star cluster in the centre of Mrk 71.

 - **Abstract**
 Transient sources are among the preferred candidates for the sources of high-energy neutrino emission. Intriguing examples so far include blazar flares and tidal disruption events coincident with IceCube neutrinos. Here, we report the first all-flavor, all-sky time-dependent search for neutrino sources by combining IceCube throughgoing tracks, starting tracks and cascades. Throughgoing tracks provide the best sensitivity in the Northern Sky, while cascades have worse angular resolution but yield better sensitivity in the Southern Sky than tracks. The relatively new starting tracks sample has reduced contamination from atmospheric muons. This analysis takes advantage of the strengths of each of the datasets, combining them for increased statistics and obtaining the best accessible all-sky sensitivity for transient searches. In this search, we look for unbound $E^{-\gamma}$ power-law sources, as well as $E^{-2}$ sources with low and high-energy exponential cutoffs, optimizing the sensitivity for the duration of the flares.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-relativistic effective field theories (NREFTs) play a crucial role in various areas of physics, from cold atom experiments to cosmology. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for deriving NREFTs from relativistic theories with generic self-interactions. Our approach allows for (but is not limited to) non-power-law potentials (such as those arising from dilatons or axions) or potentials that are non-analytic around the classical vacuum (such as those with logarithmic radiative corrections). These are of theoretical and phenomenological interest but have largely been unexplored in the non-relativistic regime. NREFTs are typically viewed as approximations for systems with low velocities, weak couplings, and small field amplitudes. The latter assumption is relaxed in our approach, as long as the mass term remains dominant (ensuring the validity of the non-relativistic limit). Additionally, we establish an effective fluid description for the non-relativistic scalar field, identifying key quantities such as energy density, pressure, and sound speed. To enable cosmological applications, we extend our formalism to account for the expanding universe, providing a reliable tool for investigating ultra-light dark matter models with arbitrary self-interactions. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our NREFT in analyzing solitons, which is also relevant to cosmology for studying celestial objects such as boson stars and the cores of dark matter halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe, capable of regulating star formation in galaxies via radiative and mechanical feedback. While AGN feedback is well studied in host galaxies, its influence on neighbouring galaxies within the same large-scale environment remains less understood. In this work, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to examine how proximity to AGN affects star formation in nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to 2 Mpc. A control sample matched in stellar mass and local density allows us to isolate AGN-driven environmental effects, quantified through the $\Delta$SFR offset defined as the difference between a galaxy's star formation rate (SFR) and that of its matched controls. We find a significant and mass-dependent impact where $61\%$ of AGN-adjacent SFGs show suppressed star formation, while $39\%$ exhibit enhancement. Although the overall magnitude of these offsets is modest, the trends are statistically robust and consistent across the population. Suppression is prevalent in massive, gas-poor galaxies in high-mass halos, consistent with thermal feedback inhibiting gas cooling. Enhanced SFRs appear in low-mass, gas-rich galaxies, suggesting AGN-driven compression may locally trigger star formation. These trends emerge despite EAGLE implementing AGN feedback as a single-mode, stochastic thermal process, indicating that such models can reproduce both quenching and triggering regimes. Our findings demonstrate that AGN feedback extends well beyond host galaxies, impacting neighbouring systems in a non-uniform, distance-, mass-, and gas-dependent manner. This non-local AGN influence represents a critical, yet often overlooked, mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within large-scale structures, bridging high-energy astrophysical processes and cosmic-scale environmental regulation.
