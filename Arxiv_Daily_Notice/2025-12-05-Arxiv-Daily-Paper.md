#### Pleiades Binary Fraction Revisited

 - **Abstract**
 One of the nearest and best studied open clusters, Pleiades is an important cornerstone of stellar astrophysics. Despite its role as reference coeval stellar population, its multiplicity properties remain vaguely determined. The combined use of Gaia DR3 multiband photometry, astrometric parameter RUWE, non-single star solutions along with available ground-based spectroscopic, high angular resolution, and polarimetric observations enable more robust constraints on the binary star population in the cluster. Several conclusions may have broader implications for other stellar populations. Twin binaries, with mass ratio close to $q\sim 1$, tend to have lower RUWE, increasing their membership selection probability, relative to $q\sim 0.5$ systems that are disfavored. The frequently observed peak in mass ratio distribution for $q\sim 1$ binaries may be partially attributed to this bias. Photometrically fitted mass ratio is underestimated for double-lined spectroscopic binaries in agreement with other authors. Differential extinction photometrically mimics stellar binarity. An area of enlarged absorption is traced by increased polarization south of the Merope star and excluded from the analysis to avoid this bias. The fraction of systems with $q>0.6$ companions is measured to be $f=16.4\%^{+2.6}_{-0.6}$ for $m>0.5~M_\odot$ stars, which is larger than recent Gaia-based estimates, but compatible with the pre-Gaia values for Pleiades and the field population. Binary fraction shows no steady increase with stellar mass in the 0.5 $-$ 1.2 $M_\odot$ range, while mass ratio has a bimodal distribution with a minimum near $q\sim 0.7$.

 - **Abstract**
 Every dark matter halo forms with a $\rho\propto r^{-1.5}$ density cusp at its center. For warm dark matter (WDM), these prompt cusps can be massive enough to influence the kinematics of dwarf galaxies. By implementing prompt cusps in the Galacticus galaxy formation model, we show that the measured velocity dispersions of Tucana V and Triangulum II are serious outliers for dwarf galaxies arising in WDM models. For thermal-relic dark matter, the three faintest Milky Way satellites together constrain the particle mass to be $m_\chi>5.8$ keV at 95 percent confidence or $m_\chi>9.4$ keV at 90 percent confidence. Improved velocity dispersion measurements for these systems could greatly refine this constraint, as could identification and kinematic characterization of more such galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct detection experiments require information about the local dark matter speed distribution to produce constraints on dark matter candidates, or infer their properties in the event of a discovery. In this paper, we analyze how the uncertainty in the dark matter speed distribution near the Sun is affected by baryonic feedback, halo-to-halo variance, and halo mass. To do so, we harness the statistical power of the new DREAMS Cold Dark Matter simulation suite, which is comprised of 1024 zoom-in Milky Way-mass halos with varied initial conditions as well as cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Applying a normalizing flows emulator to these simulations, we find that the uncertainty in the local DM speed distribution is dominated by halo-to-halo variance and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty in host halo mass. Uncertainties in supernova and black hole feedback (from the IllustrisTNG model in this case) are negligible in comparison. Using the DREAMS suite, we present a state-of-the-art prediction for the DM speed distribution in the Milky Way. Although the Standard Halo Model is contained within the uncertainty of this prediction, individual galaxies may have distributions that differ from it. Lastly, we apply our DREAMS results to the XENON1T experiment and demonstrate that the astrophysical uncertainties are comparable to the experimental ones, solidifying previous results in the literature obtained with a smaller sample of simulated Milky Way-mass halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback from active supermassive black holes alters the distribution of matter in the Universe by injecting energy in the neighbouring hot gaseous medium, which leads to ejection of gas from the halos of galaxy groups and massive galaxies. Recent cosmological simulations such as FLAMINGO calibrate their feedback model on the baryon fractions of galaxy groups to tune the efficiency of gas ejection. However, recent observational constraints from optically selected groups and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect yield lower baryon fractions than previous studies, which indicates that feedback may be more ejective than previously thought. Here we show that models involving highly ejective feedback are inconsistent with the scaling relations of local galaxy groups in the mass range $10^{13}-10^{14}M_\odot$. We study the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation in a sample of 44 galaxy groups with high-quality XMM-Newton observations. We show that highly ejective models under-predict the luminosity of galaxy groups at fixed mass at high significance ($5.7\sigma$). This conclusion is robust against selection effects and is obtained from directly measurable and minimally correlated quantities. We point out that turning observable quantities into gas fraction estimates is challenging, especially in the context of stacking large samples of heterogeneous systems. We argue that calibrating feedback models on baryon fractions is prone to systematic uncertainties and that observable scaling relations are better suited for this task.
#### Asymptotic constraints for 1D planar grey photon diffusion from linear transport with special-relativistic effects

 - **Abstract**
 We derive a grey linear diffusion equation for photons with respect to inertial (or lab-frame) space and time, using asymptotic analysis in 1D planar geometry. The solution of the equation is the comoving radiation energy density. Our analysis does not make use of assumptions about the magnitude of velocity; instead we derive an asymptotic scaling in the lab frame such that we avoid apparent non-physical pathologies that are encountered with the standard static-matter scaling. We permit the photon direction to be continuous (as opposed to constraining the analysis to discrete ordinates). The result is a drift-diffusion equation in the lab frame for comoving radiation energy density, with an adiabatic term that matches the standard semi-relativistic diffusion equation. Following a recent study for discrete directions, this equation reduces to a pure advection equation as the velocity approaches the speed of light. We perform preliminary numerical experiments comparing solutions to relativistic lab-frame Monte Carlo transport and to the well-known semi-relativistic diffusion equation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the clustering and halo occupation distribution (HOD) of DESI Y1 emission-line (ELGs) and luminous red (LRGs) galaxies at $0.8<z<1.1$, including their cross-correlation (ELG$\times$LRG), using the AbacusSummit suite and a new Halo Occupation Model (HOMe) for galaxy multi-tracers. This integrates intra-halo dynamics, halo exclusion, and quenching, bridging insights from hydrodynamical, HOD, abundance-matching, and semi-analytic studies. Leveraging full phase-space information from the Uchuu N-body simulation, and sampling satellites from dark-matter particle positions via physically motivated prescriptions, HOMe reproduces the anisotropic clustering down to $s=200\,h^{-1}$kpc with unprecedented accuracy. Model parameters are inferred solely from two-point statistics using a two-level Bayesian framework, yielding high-fidelity ELG, LRG and cross-reference catalogs. We find that satellite ELGs behave as incoherent flows within their parent halos, dominating the clustering below $4\,h^{-1}$Mpc. The HOD from the best-fit HOMe has the following properties: (i) 90.50% (85.91%) of ELGs (LRGs) are central galaxies without satellites, residing in halos of $M_{\rm vir}\sim6.6\times10^{11}\,(1.2\times10^{13})\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$; (ii) the ELG$\times$LRG cross-correlation is governed by central-central pairs and shaped by halo exclusion on $2-5\,h^{-1}$Mpc scales; (iii) 9.50% (14.09%) of ELGs (LRGs) are satellites, of which 1.09% (3.52%) inhabit halos with a central galaxy of the same species in a maximally conformal configuration, 7.02% (0.005%) orbit complementary hosts in a minimally conformal state, and 0.58% (10.57%) are orphans. HOMe high sensitivity precisely captures the dynamics of satellites in different host environments, opening a promising avenue for understanding systematics, the dynamical nature of dark matter, potentially distinguishing gravity models.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilize multi-epoch line-of-sight velocity measurements from the Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument to estimate the binary fraction for member stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor. Our dataset comprises 670 distinct member stars, with a total of more than 2,000 observations collected over approximately one year. We constrain the binary fraction for UMi to be $0.61^{+0.16}_{-0.20}$ and $0.69^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$, with the binary orbital parameter distributions based on solar neighborhood observation from Duquennoy \& Mayor (1991) and Moe \& Di Stefano (2017), respectively. Furthermore, by dividing our data into two subsamples at the median metallicity, we identify that the binary fraction for the metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-2.14) population is slightly higher than that of the metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-2.14) population. Based on the Moe \& Di Stefano model, the best-constrained binary fractions for metal-rich and metal-poor populations in UMi are $0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.24}$ and $0.48^{+0.26}_{-0.19}$, respectively. After a thorough examination, we find that this offset cannot be attributed to sample selection effects. We also divide our data into two subsamples according to their projected radius to the center of UMi, and find that the more centrally concentrated population in a denser environment has a lower binary fraction of $0.33^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$, compared with $1.00^{+0.00}_{-0.32}$ for the subsample in more outskirts.
#### Investigating the H i mass-size relation using the Simba cosmological simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Observational studies have established a remarkably tight power-law relationship between the H I masses and sizes of late-type galaxies, known as the H I mass-size relation. This relation has been shown to persist across various models of a galaxy's H I surface density profile. Using the Simba cosmological simulations, we investigate the robustness of this relation under different feedback prescriptions, including cases where specific feedback mechanisms are absent. While the global properties of galaxies are significantly affected by changes in feedback, the H I mass-size relation remains intact. Moreover, its parameters consistently align with the best available empirical measurements. We analyze the H I mass distributions of galaxies and demonstrate that, regardless of the feedback scenario, galaxies within a given H I mass bin exhibit outer H I radial profiles well approximated by an exponential function. Furthermore, the exponential decline rate remains remarkably similar across different physical prescriptions. We attribute the persistence of the H I mass-size relation to this inherent self-similarity in the H I mass distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams offer one of the most sensitive probes of the Milky Way`s gravitational potential, as their phase-space morphology encodes both the tidal field of the host galaxy and the internal structure of their progenitors. In this work, we introduce a framework that leverages Flow Matching and Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to jointly infer the parameters of the GD-1 progenitor and the global properties of the Milky Way potential. Our aim is to move beyond traditional techniques (e.g. orbit-fitting and action-angle methods) by constructing a fully Bayesian, likelihood-free posterior over both host-galaxy parameters and progenitor properties, thereby capturing the intrinsic coupling between tidal stripping dynamics and the underlying potential. To achieve this, we generate a large suite of mock GD-1-like streams using our differentiable N-body code \textsc{\texttt{Odisseo}}, sampling self-consistent initial conditions from a Plummer sphere and evolving them in a flexible Milky Way potential model. We then apply conditional Flow Matching to learn the vector field that transports a base Gaussian distribution into the posterior, enabling efficient, amortized inference directly from stream phase-space data. We demonstrate that our method successfully recovers the true parameters of a fiducial GD-1 simulation, producing well-calibrated posteriors and accurately reproducing parameter degeneracies arising from progenitor-host interactions. Flow Matching provides a powerful, flexible framework for Galactic Archaeology. Our approach enables joint inference on progenitor and Galactic parameters, capturing complex dependencies that are difficult to model with classical likelihood-based methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stellar velocity dispersion functions (VDFs) of pressure-supported galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological simulations. The central stellar velocity dispersion is one of the fundamental dynamical tracers of the total mass of galaxy subhalos, alongside luminosity and stellar mass. Because it reflects the gravitational potential, the stellar velocity dispersion is expected to be relatively insensitive to feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a critical process that regulates the connection between other galaxy observables and subhalo mass. To examine the impact of AGN feedback, we analyze the VDFs from five EAGLE simulation runs, each adopting a different AGN feedback model: one "standard", two "enhanced", one "reduced", and one with no AGN feedback. We compute the stellar velocity dispersions of pressure-supported galaxies using member stellar particles, mimicking fiber spectroscopy. The VDFs from the standard and enhanced AGN feedback models show little difference. However, contrary to our initial expectation that the VDF shape would be largely insensitive to AGN feedback, the simulations with reduced and no AGN feedback show a significant excess of high velocity dispersion galaxies ($\sigma_{*}$ > 200 km s$^{-1}$) and a deficit of low dispersion galaxies (100 < $\sigma_{*}$ (km s$^{-1}$) < 200), compared to those with standard or enhanced AGN feedback. The presence of high velocity dispersion galaxies in the no-AGN model arises from enhanced central star formation, due to the absence of AGN-driven gas heating or expulsion. Our results demonstrate that the shape of the theoretical VDF is sensitive to the strength of AGN feedback. These predictions offer a theoretical benchmark for future observational studies of the galaxy velocity dispersion function using large-scale spectroscopic surveys.
#### Formation of the Dormant Black Holes with Luminous Companions from Binary or Triple Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, a class of dormant black hole binaries with luminous companions (dBH-LC) has been observed, such as $Gaia$ BH1, BH2, and BH3. Unlike previously discovered X-ray BH binaries, this type of dBH-LC has relatively long orbital periods (typically more than several tens to a few hundred days) and shows very weak X-ray emission. Therefore, studying the formation and evolution of the whole dBH-LC population is also a very interesting problem. Our aim is to study the contribution of massive stars to the dBH-LC population under different evolutionary models (isolated binary evolution (IBE) and hierarchical triple evolution), and different formation channels (such as mass transfer, common envelope evolution). Using the Massive Objects in Binary Stellar Evolution (MOBSE) code, the Triple Stellar Evolution (TSE) code, and the latest initial multiple-star distributions, we model the populations of massive stars. Finally, we calculate the orbital properties, mass distributions, and birthrates of the BH-LC populations formed under these different conditions. In the Milky Way, we calculate that the birthrate of dBH-LC formed through IBE is about 4.35$\times$$10^{-5}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$, while the birthrate through triple evolution is about 1.47$\times$$10^{-3}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$. This means that the birthrate from triple evolution is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that from IBE. We find that in triple evolution, the main formation channel of dBH-LC is post-merger binaries formed from inner binary mergers triggered by von Zeipel$-$Lidov$-$Kozai oscillations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic investigation of long-term mid-infrared (MIR) color variability in 1,718 Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) using 14-year \textit{WISE}/NEOWISE monitoring data. Through Pearson correlation analysis between photometric magnitude and color, we identify: (1) a radio-quiet NLSy1 (RQ-NLSy1) population comprising 230 bluer-when-brighter (BWB) sources, 131 redder-when-brighter (RWB) sources, and 1,323 objects showing weak or statistically insignificant color variations; and (2) a radio-loud NLSy1 (RL-NLSy1) population containing 5 BWBs, 2 RWBs, and 27 sources with weak/no color variations. Our analysis reveals that the BWB tendency strengthens significantly in galaxies with redder mean MIR colors $\rm \left<W1-W2\right>$ and lower starlight contamination. Furthermore, this color-change pattern demonstrates that the most bolometric luminous sources exhibit the most pronounced BWB behavior. While similar trends exist for black hole mass and Eddington ratio, bolometric luminosity appears to be the primary physical driver. Potential origins of these variations (e.g., host galaxy contribution, accretion disk variability, and dust reprocessing) are discussed. We conclude that temperature-dependent dust reprocessing dominates the observed BWB, RWB, and no/weak variation patterns. This interpretation may also apply to similar MIR color variations observed in other extragalactic MIR transients, such as tidal disruption events, ambiguous nuclear transients, and changing-look AGNs. In addition, we find no significant difference in long-term MIR color variations between RL-NLSy1s and RQ-NLSy1s, however, RL-NLSy1s show significantly greater dispersion in intrinsic variability amplitude compared to RQ-NLSy1s due to jet-induced complexity, where non-thermal synchrotron emission from relativistic jets obscures thermal dust signatures.
#### MALLORN: Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on Observations of Real Nuclear transients

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST.
