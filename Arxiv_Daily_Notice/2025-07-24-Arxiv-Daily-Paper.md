 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way (MW) analog originating from enhanced linear matter power spectra $P(k)$ relative to the standard cold, collisionless DM (CDM) cosmology. We consider a Gaussian power excess in $P(k)$ followed by a cutoff in select cases; this behavior could arise from early-universe physics that alters the primordial matter power spectrum or DM physics in the radiation-dominated epoch. We find that enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in substructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF) resulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high masses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is sensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the SHMF enhancement depend on the wave number of the $P(k)$ excess and the presence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the SHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution. Additionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center and their concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement. Thus, nonlinear mode coupling must be captured to enable $P(k)$ reconstruction using DM substructure.

 - **Abstract**
 A star destroyed by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a tidal disruption event (TDE) gives rise to a luminous flare. TDEs are being detected at an ever-increasing rate, motivating the need for accurate models of their lightcurves. The ``maximum gravity'' (MG) model posits that a star is completely destroyed when the tidal field of the SMBH exceeds the maximum self-gravitational field within the star, $g_{\rm max}$, and predicts the peak fallback rate $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$ and the time to peak $t_{\rm peak}$. Here we perform hydrodynamical simulations of the complete disruption of 24 stars with masses ranging from $0.2-5.0 M_\odot$, at different stages of their main sequence evolution, to test the predictions of this model. We find excellent agreement between the MG model predictions and our simulations for stars near the zero-age main sequence, while the predictions are less accurate (but still within $\sim 35-50\%$ of the simulation results) for highly evolved stars. We also generalize the MG model to incorporate the Paczy{ń}ski-Wiita potential to assess the impact of strong-gravity effects -- which are especially important for deep encounters that are required to completely destroy evolved and centrally concentrated stars -- and find good agreement with recent works that include relativistic gravity. Our results demonstrate that this model provides accurate constraints on the peak timescale of TDE lightcurves and their correlation with black hole mass.
#### Unusually High Gas-to-Dust Ratios Observed in High-Redshift Quiescent Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Tracking the cold molecular gas contents of galaxies is critical to understand the interplay between star formation and galaxy growth across cosmic time. Observations of the long-wavelength dust continuum, a proxy for the cold gas, are widely used in the high-redshift community because of their ease and efficiency. These measurements rely on the assumption of a molecular gas-to-dust mass ratio, typically taken to be GDR ~ 100 in massive, metal-rich systems. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the 870um dust continuum in a sample of five massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 1 with existing detections of CO(2-1). We find surprisingly weak dust emission, falling a factor of >~0.4-0.8 dex below the typical correlation between CO and continuum luminosity. We interpret this dust deficiency as evidence for unusually high GDR in these galaxies, which we calculate to range from 300 to at least 1200. Our results and other observations from the literature are generally compatible with predictions from the SIMBA cosmological simulation that dust is preferentially destroyed in quiescent galaxies. Ultimately, we conclude that the dust continuum is a highly unreliable tracer of the molecular gas in high-redshift quiescent galaxies. As a consequence we may know much less about the cold gas contents of this population than previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 Advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of early massive galaxies and black holes requires detailed studies of dense structures in the high-redshift Universe. In this work, we present high-angular resolution ($\simeq0.3''$) ALMA observations targeting the CO(4--3) line and the underlying 3-mm dust continuum toward the Cosmic Web node MQN01, a region identified through deep multiwavelength surveys as one of the densest concentrations of galaxies and AGN at cosmic noon. At the center of this structure, we identify a massive, rotationally supported disk galaxy located approximately at $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ projected-distance and $\sim-300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ from a hyperluminous quasar at $z=3.2510$. By accurately modeling the cold gas kinematics, we determine a galaxy dynamical mass of $2.5\times10^{11}\,{M_{\odot}}$ within the inner $\simeq 4\,{\rm kpc}$, and a high degree of rotational support of $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma \approx 11$. This makes it the first quasar companion galaxy confirmed as a massive, dynamically cold rotating disk at such an early cosmic epoch. Despite the small projected separation from the quasar host, we find no clear evidence of strong tidal interactions affecting the galaxy disk. This might suggest that the quasar is a satellite galaxy in the early stages of a merger. Furthermore, our spectroscopic analysis reveals a broad, blueshifted component in the CO(4--3) line profile of the quasar host, which may trace a powerful molecular outflow or kinematic disturbances induced by its interaction with the massive companion galaxy. Our findings show that rotationally supported cold disks are able to survive even in high-density environments of the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional N-body methods introduce localised perturbations in the gravitational forces governing their evolution. These perturbations lead to an artificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale Structure, often referred to as "beads-on-a-string." This issue is particularly apparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at small spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations induced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the suppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian perturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown to minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we investigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for dark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the severity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly improves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a fixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious haloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial conditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo formation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening counterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore, initialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in z=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This sphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying spurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology. We propose potential strategies for reducing spurious haloes without abandoning current N-body methods.
#### Detection of a dark matter sub-halo near the Sun from pulsar timing

 - **Abstract**
 Using pulsar accelerations, we identify and constrain the properties of a dark matter sub-halo in the Galaxy for the first time from analyzing the excess, correlated power in the acceleration field of binary pulsars. We find that this sub-halo has a mass of $1.02^{+3.47}_{-0.90} \times 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ and is located at Galactic coordinates $d = 0.93^{+0.32}_{-0.38}$ kpc, $b=36.78^{+17.59}_{-23.55}$, $l=30.16^{+19.36}_{-23.82}$, or equivalently at Galactocentric coordinates $X = 7.52^{+0.34}_{-0.38}~\rm$ kpc, $Y = 0.36^{+0.39}_{-0.43} ~\rm kpc$, $Z = 0.53^{+0.41}_{-0.45} ~\rm kpc$. We examine \textit{Gaia} data and the atomic and molecular hydrogen data of our Galaxy and show that this excess power cannot arise from the gas or the stars in our Galaxy. Additionally, by analyzing the full sample of binary pulsars with available acceleration measurements that span 3.4 kpc in Galactocentric radius from the Sun and 3.6 kpc in vertical height, we find that massive (with mass $>10^{8}~M_{\odot}~$) sub-halos are disfavored for the Milky Way within several kiloparsec of the Sun. The detection of a $10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ sub-halo within a few kpc of the Sun is potentially consistent with the expected number counts of sub-halos in the prevailing $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, for a substantial sub-halo mass fraction. The pulsar accelerations are however better fit by a compact object, such as arising from a primordial black hole or a sub-halo having a steep density profile, as in self-interacting dark matter. As the number and precision of direct acceleration measurements continues to grow, we will obtain tighter constraints on dark matter sub-structure in our Galaxy. These measurements now open a new avenue for studying dark matter and have implications across many fields of astrophysics - from understanding the nature of dark matter to galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The post-quenching evolution process of early-type galaxies (ETGs) is still not fully understood. The amount of growth in stellar mass and size incurred after quenching is still under debate. Aims: In this work we aim to investigate the late evolution of ETGs, both observationally and theoretically, by focusing on the stellar mass density profile inside a fixed aperture, within $10$~kpc from the galaxy center. Methods: We first studied the stellar mass and mass-weighted density slope within $10 ~\rm{kpc}$, respectively $M_{*,10}$ and $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}}$, of a sample of early-type galaxies from the GAMA survey. We measured the \gmr~and its evolution over the redshift range $0.17\leq z \leq 0.37$. We then built a toy model for the merger evolution of galaxies, based on N-body simulations, to explore to what extent the observed growth in \gmr~is consistent with a dry-merger evolution scenario. Results: From the observations, we do not detect evidence for an evolution of the \gmr relation. We put an upper limit on $~(\mu)$ and $~(\beta)$ of the \gmr: $|\partial \mu/\partial \log (1+z)| \leq 0.13$ and $\left|\partial \beta/\partial \log (1+z)\right| \leq 1.10$, respectively. Simulations show that most mergers induce a decrease in $\mathit{\Gamma_{*,10}}$ and an increase in $M_{*,10}$, although some show a decrease in $M_{*,10}$, particularly for the most extended galaxies and smaller merger mass ratios. By combining the observations with our merger toy model, we placed an upper limit on $f_M = 11.2 \%$ in the redshift range $0.17 \leq z \leq 0.37$. Conclusions: While our measurement is limited by systematics, the application of our approach to samples with a larger redshift baseline, particularly with a time interval $\Delta t \geq 3.2~\mathrm{Gyr}$, should enable us to detect a signal and help us better understand the late growth of ETGs.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of tidal disruption events (TDEs) is one of the key science goals of large optical time-domain surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. However, identifying TDEs in the vast alert streams produced by these surveys requires automated and reliable classification pipelines that can select promising candidates in real time. We developed a module within the Fink alert broker to identify TDEs during their rising phase. It was built to autonomously operate within the ZTF alert stream, producing a list of candidates every night and enabling spectral and multi-wavelength follow-up near peak brightness. All rising alerts are submitted to selection cuts and feature extraction using the Rainbow multi-band lightcurve fit. Best-fit values were used as input to train an XGBoost classifier with the goal of identifying TDEs. The training set was constructed using ZTF observations for objects with available classification in the Transient Name Server. Finally, candidates with high enough probability were visually inspected. The classifier achieves 76% recall, indicating strong performance in early-phase identification, despite the limited available information before peak. We show that, out of the known TDEs that pass the selection cuts, half of them are flagged as TDE before halfway in their rise, proving the feasibility of early classification. Additionally, new candidates were identified by applying the classifier on archival data, including a likely repeated TDE and some potential TDEs occurring in active galaxies. The module is implemented into the Fink alert processing framework, reporting each night a small number of candidates to dedicated communication channels through a user-friendly interface, for manual vetting and potential follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution history of the Milky Way disk is imprinted in the ages, positions, and chemical compositions of individual stars. In this study, we derive the intrinsic density distribution of different stellar populations using the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. A total of 203,197 red giant branch stars are used to sort the stellar disk ($R \leq 20$ kpc) into sub-populations of metallicity ($\Delta$[M/H]$= 0.1$ dex), age ($\Delta \log(\frac{\textrm{age}}{\textrm{yr}})= 0.1$), and $\alpha$-element abundances ([$\alpha$/M]). We fit the present-day structural parameters and density distribution of each stellar sub-population after correcting for the survey selection function. The low-$\alpha$ disk is characterized by longer scale lengths and shorter scale heights, and is best fit by a broken exponential radial profile for each population. The high-$\alpha$ disk is characterized by shorter scale lengths and larger scale heights, and is generally well-approximated by a single exponential radial profile. These results are applied to produce new estimates of the integrated properties of the Milky Way from early times to the present day. We measure the total stellar mass of the disk to be $5.27^{+0.2}_{-1.5} \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and the average mass-weighted scale length is $R_{d} = 2.37 \pm 0.2$ kpc. The Milky Way's present-day color of $(g-r) = 0.72 \pm 0.02$ is consistent with the classification of a red spiral galaxy, although it has only been in the "green valley" region of the galaxy color-mass diagram for the last $\sim 3$ Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 Using our rich observations within the Milky Way to better understand galaxy evolution requires understanding what the Milky Way looks like "as a galaxy" -- that is, its "true" shape and abundance profiles (unskewed by observational biases), signatures of past mergers and significant accretion events, and even its total stellar mass and integrated SED, which have historically been difficult to constrain. We present a new approach to determining the Milky Way's integrated mass and colors, using recent measurements of the intrinsic density profiles of stellar populations spanning nearly 13 Gyr in time and 1.5 dex in metallicity (representing nearly all of the Galaxy's stars). We trace the evolution of the Milky Way in various diagnostic spaces, explore the impact of specific events on the present-day Milky Way's integrated properties, and use TNG50 simulations to identify "young" Galactic analogs and their eventual fates, compared to the real Milky Way's path. From the simulation comparisons, we find strong evidence for an earlier-than-average stellar mass assembly of the MW, and that present-day MW analogs follow a similar growth history, albeit at slightly later times; we also find that analogs of the early MW are in no way guaranteed to follow the MW's subsequent path. This empirical study offers new constraints on our "Galaxy as a galaxy" -- today and across cosmic time -- and on its place in the general galactic population.
#### A first measurement of baryonic feedback with Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic feedback fundamentally alters the total matter distribution on small to intermediate cosmological scales, posing a significant challenge for contemporary cosmological analyses. Direct tracers of the baryon distribution are therefore key for unearthing cosmological information buried under astrophysical effects. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a novel and direct probe of baryons, tracing the integrated ionised electron density along the line-of-sight, quantified by the dispersion measure (DM). The scatter of the DM as a function of redshift provides insight into the lumpiness of the electron distribution and, consequently, baryonic feedback processes. Using a model calibrated to the \texttt{BAHAMAS} hydrodynamical simulation suite, we forward-model the statistical properties of the DM with redshift. Applying this model to approximately 100 localised FRBs, we constrain the governing feedback parameter, $\log T_\mathrm{AGN}$. Our findings represent the first measurement of baryonic feedback using FRBs, demonstrating a strong rejection of no-feedback scenarios at greater than $99.7\,\%$ confidence ($3\sigma$), depending on the FRB sample. We find that FRBs prefer fairly strong feedback, similar to other measurements of the baryon distribution, via the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The results are robust against sightline correlations and modelling assumptions. We emphasise the importance of accurate calibration of the host galaxy and Milky Way contributions to the DM. Furthermore, we discuss implications for future FRB surveys and necessary improvements to current models to ensure accurate fitting of upcoming data, particularly that from low-redshift FRBs.
