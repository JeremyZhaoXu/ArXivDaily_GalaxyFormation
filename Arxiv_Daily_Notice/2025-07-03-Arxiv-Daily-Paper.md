 - **Abstract**
 Many theoretical and observational studies have suggested that galaxy mergers may trigger enhanced star formation or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity. We present an analysis of merging and nonmerging galaxies from $0.2 \leq z \leq 3$ in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. These galaxies encompass a range of masses ($M_\star > 10^{8}M_\odot$), multiple merger stages, and mass ratios ($\geq1:10$). We examine the effect that galaxy mergers have on star formation and black hole accretion rates in the TNG50 universe. We additionally investigate how galaxy and black hole mass, merger stage, merger mass ratio, and redshift affect these quantities. Mergers in our sample show excess specific star formation rates (sSFR) at $z \leq 3$ and enhanced specific black hole accretion rates (sBHAR) at $z \lesssim 2$. The difference between sSFRs and sBHARs in the merging sample compared to the non-merging sample increases as redshift decreases. Additionally, we show that these enhancements persist for at least $\sim1$ Gyr after the merger event. Investigating how mergers behave in the TNG50 simulation throughout cosmic time enables both a better appreciation of the importance of spatial resolution in cosmological simulations and a better basis to understand our high-$z$ universe with observations from \textit{JWST}.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave event GW230529 was the first compact binary merger observation reported in the fourth observing run of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observatory network. The more massive component of the GW230529 source binary was inferred to contain a compact object in the lower mass gap, a purported gap between the most massive neutron stars and least massive black holes based on compact object observations in the Milky Way. However, the properties of the mass-gap object, such as its exact mass and spin, remain unresolved due to statistical uncertainties. To investigate the properties of the GW230529 source binary, we perform parameter estimation on a suite of simulated gravitational wave systems with similar parameters. We vary the intrinsic properties of the simulated systems, the detector noise properties, the signal-to-noise ratios, and the waveform model used in recovery. We find that the low signal-to-noise ratio of GW230529 is the key reason for the ambiguity in determining whether the mass of the primary object in the binary is consistent with a low-mass black hole or a high-mass neutron star, since the priors for the masses and spins have a significant impact on the posterior distribution. The inclusion of tidal effects in the waveform model also contributes to the observed degeneracies in the posteriors. We show that a higher signal-to-noise ratio in future observations of mass-gap gravitational wave sources will increase the precision of the measurements and allow us to determine whether the components are black holes or neutron stars.
#### Radio emission from tidal disruption events produced by the collision between super-Eddington outflows and the circumnuclear medium

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01273

 - **Abstract**
 In this Letter, we simulate the collision between outflows from the tidal disruption of a 1M$_\odot$ main sequence star around a $10^6$M$_\odot$ black hole and an initially spherically symmetric circumnuclear cloud. We launch super-Eddington outflows self-consistently by simulating the disruption of stars on both bound and unbound initial orbits using general relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find shocks formed as early as $\sim 10~$days after the initial stellar disruption produce prompt radio emission. The shock radius ($\approx~10^{17}$~cm), velocity ($\sim 0.15$c) and total energy ($\sim 10^{51}$ erg) in our simulations match those inferred from radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We ray-trace to produce synthetic radio images and spectra to compare with the observations. While the TDE outflow is quasi-spherical, the synchrotron emitting region is aspherical but with reflection symmetry above and below the initial orbital plane. Our synthetic spectra show continuous decay in peak frequency, matching prompt radio TDE observations. Our model supports the hypothesis that synchrotron radio flares from TDEs result from the collision between outflows and the circumnuclear material.
#### Radial velocities and stellar populations for a sample of MATLAS survey dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations are essential for confirming associations, measuring kinematics, and determining stellar populations in dwarf galaxies. Here, we present Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) spectra for 12 MATLAS survey dwarfs. For 9, we confirm recession velocities consistent with their literature-assumed host galaxies. We propose revisions of the host galaxy associations for MATLAS-631, 1494, and 1938. For MATLAS-1494, our measured redshift reclassifies it from an ultra-diffuse galaxy candidate to a dwarf galaxy that is of smaller physical size and places it in the field. It also appears old and passive, providing a challenge to models that invoke quenching by tidal effects. Additionally, we measure stellar population estimates for 7 of the 12 galaxies, finding a 'mixed bag' of old quenched galaxies and those that are currently forming stars. Compared to the literature we find generally younger ages and higher metallicities. This result may help reconcile the observed offset of MATLAS survey dwarf galaxies from the universal stellar mass-metallicity relationship reported by Heesters et al. (2023).

 - **Abstract**
 The large variety and number of dark energy (DE) theories make it impractical to perform detailed analyses on a case-by-case basis, which has motivated proposals to ``parameterize" theories to reduce the size of theory space. The leading approach to do this is the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE), which can describe general Horndeski-type theories with a small number of observationally accessible time-dependent functions. However, the EFTofDE primarily works for linear perturbations, and extending it to obtain a fully non-linear description of DE theories, which is critical for theories with screening mechanisms, is challenging. In this paper, we present a general method for reconstructing the non-linear DE Lagrangian from the background expansion history and certain linear-perturbation quantities, building upon the EFTofDE framework. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this method is applicable to a wide range of single-scalar-field dark energy and modified gravity theories, including quintessence, scalar-tensor theory, $k$-essence, and generalized cubic Galileon with shift symmetry. For each of these theories, we discuss the validity of the method and factors affecting its results. While this method involves solving differential equations, we find that the initial conditions are not important for quintessence, scalar-tensor theory and $k$-essence, while for shift-symmetric cubic Galileon, the generic tracker solution can help transform differential equations into algebraic equations. This offers a useful framework to connect cosmological observations at the background and linear-perturbation levels to the underlying non-linear dynamics of dark energy, and will enable cosmological simulations to analyze and examine DE theories systematically and in much greater detail.
#### Numerical treatment of annual modulation of relic neutrinos

 - **Abstract**
 We present a numerical treatment of the annual modulation of relic neutrinos due to the Sun's gravitational influence. Extending our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework from Milky Way scales to solar system dynamics, we model how cosmic neutrino background densities might vary throughout Earth's orbital cycle. We validate our numerical approach against analytical expectations from previous studies that assumed idealized relic neutrino populations. Our results suggest that the prior gravitational history of neutrinos traversing asymmetric dark matter distributions can affect annual modulation patterns. While our simulations reproduce modulation amplitudes similar to analytical predictions for heavier neutrinos, we find that the amplitude can vary considerably depending on the specific morphology of dark matter halos. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating realistic structure formation effects when predicting potential observational relic neutrino signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius A* provides a unique opportunity to test general relativity and study dynamical processes near a supermassive black hole. Observations have shown that the orbit of S2 is consistent with a Schwarzschild orbit at a 10$\sigma$ confidence level, constraining the amount of extended mass within its orbit to less than 1200 M$_\odot$, under the assumption of a smooth, spherically symmetric mass distribution. In this work we investigate the effects on the S2 orbit of granularity in the mass distribution, assuming it consists of a cluster of equal-mass objects surrounding Sagittarius A*. Using a fast dynamical approach validated by full N-body simulations, we perform a large set of simulations of the motion of S2 with different realizations of the cluster objects distribution. We find that granularity can induce significant deviations from the orbit in case of a smooth potential, causing precession of the orbital plane and a variation of the in-plane precession. Interactions with the cluster objects also induce a sort of "Brownian motion" of Sagittarius A*. Mock data analysis reveals that these effects could produce observable deviations in the trajectory of S2 from a Schwarzschild orbit, especially near apocenter. During the next apocenter passage of S2 in 2026, astrometric residuals in Declination may exceed the astrometric accuracy threshold of GRAVITY of about 30 $\mu as$, as it happens in 35 to 60% of simulations for black holes of 20 to 100 M$_\odot$. This presents a unique opportunity to detect, for the first time, scattering effects on the orbit of S2 caused by stellar-mass black holes, thanks to the remarkable precision achievable with GRAVITY. We also demonstrate that any attempt to constrain the extended mass enclosed within the orbit of S2 must explicitly account for granularity in the stellar-mass black hole population.

 - **Abstract**
 Increasing evidence shows that most stars in the Milky Way, including the Sun, are born in star-forming regions containing also high-mass stars, but due to both observational and theoretical challenges, our comprehension of their chemical evolution is far less clear than that of their low-mass counterparts. We present the project "CHemical Evolution of MassIve star-froming COres" (CHEMICO). The project aims at investigating any aspect of the chemical evolution of high-mass star-forming cores by observing representatives of the three main evolutionary categories: high-mass starless cores, high-mass protostellar objects, and ultra-compact HII regions. We carried out an unbiased spectral line survey of the entire bandwidth at 3, 2, and 1.2 mm with the 30m telescope of the Insitut de Radioastronomie millimetrique towards three targets that represent the three evolutionary stages. The number of lines and species detected increases with evolution. In this first work, we derive the temperature structure of the targets through the analysis of the carbon-bearing species C2H, c-C3H, c-C3H2, C4H, CH3CCH, HC3N, CH3CN, and HC5N. The excitation temperature, Tex, increases with evolution in each species, although not in the same way. Hydrocarbons tend to be associated with the smallest Tex values and enhancements with evolution, while cyanides are associated with the highest Tex values and enhancements. In each target, the higher the number of atoms in the molecule, the higher Tex tends to be. The temperature structure evolves from a cold, uniform envelope traced by simple hydrocarbons in the high-mass starless core stage, to a more stratified envelope in the protostellar stage (made by a hot core, a shell with intermediate Tex, and a larger cold envelope), to finally a hot core surrounded only by a cold envelope in the Ultracompact HII stage.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first cosmological constraints from a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing using extended SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAMe). We analyse stellar mass-selected Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) galaxy clustering and Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) galaxy-galaxy lensing and find constraints on $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}=0.793^{+0.025}_{-0.024}$, in agreement with Planck at 1.7$\sigma$, and consistent with previous results. We are able to constrain all 5 SHAMe parameters, which describe the galaxy-subhalo connection. We validate our methodology by first applying it to simulated catalogues, generated from the TNG300 simulation, which mimic the stellar mass selection of our real data. We show that we are able to recover the input cosmology for both our fiducial and all-scale analyses. Our all-scale analysis extends to scales of galaxy-galaxy lensing below $r_\mathrm{p}<1.4\,\mathrm{Mpc}/h$, which we exclude in our fiducial analysis to avoid baryonic effects. When including all scales, we find a value of $S_8$, which is 1.26$\sigma$ higher than our fiducial result (against naive expectations where baryonic feedback should lead to small-scale power suppression), and in agreement with Planck at 0.9$\sigma$. We also find a 21% tighter constraint on $S_8$ and a 29% tighter constraint on $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ compared to our fiducial analysis. This work shows the power and potential of joint small-scale galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses using SHAMe.
#### Tidal Suppression of Fuzzy Dark Matter Heating in Milky Way Satellite Galaxies

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01686

 - **Abstract**
 Many previous studies have imposed stringent constraints on the particle mass of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) by analyzing observations of Galactic satellite galaxies, which show no significant evidence of the heating effect predicted by FDM. However, these analyses have generally neglected the tidal influence of the Milky Way, which can substantially suppress the FDM-induced heating in satellites. This oversight arises from computational challenges of accurately capturing the tidal effects in FDM simulations. In this study, we present a novel simulation framework that, for the first time, enables the simulation of an FDM-stellar system within an observationally motivated gravitational potential of the Milky Way. This framework incorporates the diverse Galactic components, including the gravitational influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using the Fornax dwarf galaxy as a case study, we demonstrate that tidal effects significantly alleviate the tension between observational data and the predicted heating effect for an FDM particle mass of $m_a\sim 10^{-22}$ eV.
#### Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments in EAGLE: enhanced SMBH growth in misaligned galaxies

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01894

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments are a transient phenomenon observed in $\sim11\%$ of the local galaxy population. According to current models, misaligned gas is expected to lose angular momentum and relax into the galactic plane on timescales of $\sim0.1$ Gyr, driving gas toward the central regions of the galaxy. Recent observational studies have found a higher incidence of active galactic nuclei in misaligned galaxies. We use the EAGLE simulation to explore the connection between stellar-gas misalignments and enhanced central black hole (BH) activity between $0<z<1$. We use a sample of $\sim5600$ galaxies with a stellar mass of $M_{*}\geqslant \mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\odot$ that feature long-lived stellar-gas alignment, counter-rotation, and unstable misalignments (non-coplanarity). Over time windows of $0.5$ Gyr, we find that galaxies experiencing an unstable misalignment have systematically enhanced BH growth during relaxation. Galaxies with long-term counter-rotation show little difference in BH growth compared to aligned galaxies. We suggest that this enhanced BH growth is driven by loss of angular momentum in unstable misaligned gas discs which is able to drive gas inward toward the vicinity of the BH. At $z\approx0.1$, we find a greater incidence of overmassive BHs in galaxies that have spent a greater fraction of time with unstable stellar-gas kinematic misalignments over the preceding $\approx2$ Gyr compared to control samples of aligned galaxies. In agreement with observations, we conclude that BH activity is enhanced in misaligned systems in EAGLE and suggest that the presence of overmassive BHs may be indicative of a past stellar-gas kinematic misalignment.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-wavelength imaging and analysis of a low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxy in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS), SMDG0333094-280938, with particular emphasis on data from the Euclid space telescope and from the Vera C.\ Rubin Observatory. The galaxy is clumpy and blue, and appears to host globular clusters (GCs), suggesting a distance of ~50-60 Mpc which would make the dwarf an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG). We carry out spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting from the far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, in order to estimate the galaxy age and metallicity. We infer a recent peak of star formation that may have led to the formation of the UDG through feedback-driven expansion. This early analysis illustrates how Euclid and Rubin are poised to identify and characterize many thousands of UDGs and other LSB galaxies in the near future, including their GCs and stellar populations.
#### ML-Driven Strong Lens Discoveries: Down to $θ_E \sim 0.03''$ and $M_\mathrm{halo}< 10^{11} M_\odot$

 - **Abstract**
 We present results on extending the strong lens discovery space down to much smaller Einstein radii ($\theta_E\lesssim0.03''$) and much lower halo mass ($M_\mathrm{halo}<10^{11}M_\odot$) through the combination of JWST observations and machine learning (ML) techniques. First, we forecast detectable strong lenses with JWST using CosmoDC2 as the lens catalog, and a source catalog down to 29th magnitude. By further incorporating the VELA hydrodynamical simulations of high-redshift galaxies, we simulate strong lenses. We train a ResNet on these images, achieving near-100\% completeness and purity for ``conventional" strong lenses ($\theta_E\gtrsim 0.5''$), applicable to JWST, HST, the Roman Space Telescope and Euclid VIS. For the first time, we also search for very low halo mass strong lenses ($M_{halo}<10^{11}M_\odot$) in simulations, with $\theta_E\ll 0.5''$, down to the best resolution ($0.03''$) and depth (10,000~sec) limits of JWST using ResNet. A U-Net model is employed to pinpoint these small lenses in images, which are otherwise virtually impossible for human detection. Our results indicate that JWST can find $\sim 17$/deg$^2$ such low-halo-mass lenses, with the locations of $\sim 1.1$/deg$^2$ of these detectable by the U-Net at $\sim100$\% precision (and $\sim 7.0$/deg$^2$ at a 99.0\% precision). To validate our model for finding ``conventional" strong lenses, we apply it to HST images, discovering two new strong lens candidates previously missed by human classifiers in a crowdsourcing project (Garvin et al. 2022). This study demonstrates the (potentially ``superhuman") advantages of ML combined with current and future space telescopes for detecting conventional, and especially, low-halo-mass strong lenses, which are critical for testing CDM models.

 - **Abstract**
 The varied and dynamic evolutionary histories of galaxies give rise to the stunning diversity in their properties that we observe in the present-day universe. HST, and now JWST, have pioneered the study of resolved individual stars in the Milky Way and other members of the Local Group, uncovering the drivers of their morphological, star formation, and chemical evolution. HWO will constitute a paradigm shift: introducing the ability to panchromatically resolve the main bodies of every galaxy in the Local Volume into their constituent stars. In this science case, we summarize the breakthrough progress that HWO will advance in the field of galaxy evolution through resolved stellar populations. HWO will transform our understanding of galaxies in three distance regimes: (1) in the nearest galaxies ($\sim$5 Mpc), where it will resolve stars below the oldest Main Sequence Turnoff, enabling precision stellar astrophysics and star formation history (SFH) inferences to the earliest cosmic times; (2) in the greater Local Volume ($\sim$20 Mpc), where it will resolve stars below the Red Clump, providing access to accurate SFHs for hundreds of galaxies, spanning the entire Hubble Sequence; and (3) out to cosmological volumes ($\sim$50+ Mpc), providing access to the luminous stellar populations in thousands of galaxies, enabling unprecedented views of their morphology, stellar abundances, and dust content. The principal technological requirement advanced by this science case is a camera with a resolution of $\leqslant$0.015'' that is diffraction-limited, and Nyquist-sampled (0.01'' per pixel), to at least 550 nm $-$ comparable to the High Definition Imager from the LUVOIR concept.
