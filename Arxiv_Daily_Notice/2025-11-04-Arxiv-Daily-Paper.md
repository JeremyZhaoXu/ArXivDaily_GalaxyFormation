 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of gas-phase metals within galaxies encodes the impact of stellar feedback on galactic evolution. At high-redshift, when galaxies are rapidly assembling, feedback-driven outflows and turbulence can strongly reshape radial metallicity gradients. In this work, we use the FIRE-2, SPICE, Thesan and Thesan Zoom cosmological simulations -- spanning a range of stellar feedback from bursty (time-variable) to smooth (steady) -- to investigate how these feedback modes shape gas-phase metallicity gradients at $3<z\lesssim11$. Across all models, we find that galaxies with bursty feedback (FIRE-2, SPICE Bursty, and Thesan Zoom) develop systematically flatter (factors of $\sim2-10$) metallicity gradients than those with smooth feedback (SPICE Smooth and Thesan Box), particularly at stellar masses $M_\star > 10^{9}~{\rm M_\odot}$. These results demonstrate that bursty stellar feedback provides sufficient turbulence to prevent strong negative gradients from forming, while smooth stellar feedback does not generically allow for efficient radial redistribution of metals thereby keeping gradients steep. Finally, we compare with recent observations, finding that the majority -- but, notably, not all -- of the observed gradients may favor a bursty stellar feedback scenario. In all, these results highlight the utility of high-resolution observations of gas-phase metallicity at high-redshift as a key discriminator of these qualitatively different feedback types.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter subhalos and satellite galaxies in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from the ``overmerging'' problem, where inadequate force and/or mass resolution cause artificially enhanced tidal mass loss and premature disruption. Previous idealized simulations addressing this issue have been restricted to a small subset of the subhalo orbital parameter space, and all assumed subhalos to be isotropic. Here, we present the first extensive simulation suite that quantifies numerical convergence in the tidal evolution of anisotropic subhalos under varying numerical resolutions and orbits. We report a universal force resolution criterion: the subhalo's instantaneous tidal radius must always be resolved by at least 20 cells in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based simulations, or by 20 softening lengths (Plummer equivalent) in tree-based simulations, regardless of refinement details or subhalo physical properties such as concentration or velocity anisotropy. We also report a universal expression for the discreteness-noise-driven scatter in the bound-mass fraction of subhalos that depends only on the subhalo mass resolution at infall and the instantaneous bound mass fraction, agnostic of any further subhalo properties. Such stochastic discreteness noise causes both premature disruption and, notably, spurious survival of poorly mass-resolved subhalos. We demonstrate that as many as 50 percent of all subhalos in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations are likely to be either force and/or mass unresolved. Our findings advocate for adaptive softening or grid refinement based on the instantaneous tidal radius of the subhalo.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids are magnetized at the level of at least $10^{-17}$ G on Mpc scales, as implied by blazar observations. We show that an electrically conducting plasma is present in the voids, and that, because of the plasma, \emph{diffusion} into the voids of galactic fields generated by a mean-field dynamo is far too slow to explain the present-day void magnetization. Indeed, we show that even in the presence of turbulence in the voids, dynamo-generated galactic fields diffuse out to a galactocentric radius of only 200-400 kpc. Therefore, it is challenging to meet the required volume filling-factor of the void magnetic field. We conclude that a primordial origin remains the most natural explanation to the space-filling weak fields in voids.

 - **Abstract**
 In the Milky Way disk there is a strong trend linking stellar age to surface element abundances. Here we explore this relationship with a dataset of 8,803 red-giant and red-clump stars with both asteroseismic data from NASA Kepler Mission and surface abundances from the SDSS-V MWM. We find, with a k-nearest-neighbors approach, that the [Mg/H] and [Fe/Mg] abundance ratios predict asteroseismic ages to an accuracy of about 2 Gyr for the majority of stars. That said, there are substantial outlier stars whose surface abundances do not match their asteroseismic ages. Because asteroseismic ages for these stars are fundamentally based on density or mass, these outliers are mass-transfer candidates. Stars whose surface abundances predict a younger age (higher mass) than what's seen in the asteroseismology are mass accretor candidates (MAC); stars whose abundances predict an older age (lower mass) than the asteroseismology age are mass donor candidates (MDC). We create precise control samples, matched according to (1) surface abundances and (2) asteroseismic ages, for both the MAC and MDC stars; we use these to find slight differences in rotational velocity, [C/N], and [Na/Mg] between the mass-transfer candidates and their abundance neighbors. We find no drastic differences in kinematics, orbital invariants, UV excess, or other stellar abundances between outliers and their abundance neighbors. We deliver 377 mass-transfer candidates for follow-up observations. This project implicitly suggests a fundamental limit on the reliability of asteroseismic ages, and supports existing evidence that age-abundance outliers are products of binary mass transfer.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution and the abundance of metals in the intergalactic medium (IGM) have strong implications on galaxy formation and evolution models. The ionic transitions of heavy elements in quasar spectra can probe both the mechanisms and the sources of chemical pollution, but high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra are required, as the IGM absorbers can be too weak for direct detection. In this work, we investigate the IGM metallicity, focusing on the detection of the weak absorption lines. We exploited the cosmological tool of the two-point correlation function (TPCF) and applied it to the transmitted flux in the CIV forest of the ultra-high S/N UVES spectrum of the quasar HE0940-1050 (z~3). We also "deabsorbed" the strongest circum-galactic medium (CGM) systems to reveal the underlying IGM signal. For each test, we generated 1000 mock spectra with shuffled line positions to derive an estimate for the TPCF noise level. The TPCF shows a clear peak at the characteristic velocity separation of the CIV doublet, but when deabsorbing the CGM contribution (i.e. all metal lines and CIV lines associated with logN(HI)>14.0), the peak is no longer significant at 1$\sigma$, although 7 weak CIV systems remain visible. Even adding up to 135 additional weak mock CIV systems (logN(HI)<14.0) to the spectrum does not produce a significant CIV peak. Eventually, when we create a synthetic spectrum with gaussian distributed noise and same S/N as the complete spectrum, we remove the signal caused by the spectral intrinsic features and thus find a peak compatible with a metallicity of -3.80<[C/H]<-3.50. We conclude that the TPCF method is not sensitive to the presence of the weakest systems in the real spectrum, despite the extremely high S/N and high resolution of the data. However, the results of this statistical technique would possibly change when combining more than one line of sight.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way halo has been built-up over cosmic time through the accretion and dissolution of star clusters and dwarf galaxies as well as through their complex interactions with the Galactic disc. Traces of these accreted structures persist to the present day in the chemical and kinematic properties of stars and their orbits and allow for the disentangling of the accretion history of the Galaxy through observations of Milky Way stars. We utilised 6D phase-space information in combination with [Fe/H] measurements to facilitate a clustering analysis of stars using their kinematics and chemistry simultaneously, a technique known as chemo-kinematic tagging. Using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), we performed dimensionality reduction and identify stars from clusters and streams that are co-localised in the kinematic and chemical parameter space. We included E, Jr, Jz, Lz, r_apo, r_peri, and eccentricity as well as [Fe/H] as input into the algorithm, and used a sample of 5347 stars from 229 individual Milky Way substructures compiled from various sources in the literature. Most notably, we recovered several large-scale structures that have been reported in the literature, including GSE, Thamnos, Sequoia, I'itoi, LMS-1/Wukong, Sagittarius, Kraken/Koala, the splashed disc, and a candidate structure recently found in another work. We find that 44\% of Milky Way globular clusters are consistent with having an accreted origin. We also find that the chemo-dynamic properties of omega cen are consistent with a common accretion with the Thamnos structure. In addition, we identified many stream-progenitor associations, most notably a connection between the Orphan-Chenab stream and the Grus II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, which supports previous findings that these two objects were brought into the Galaxy in the same accretion event.
#### Supplementing the 2MRS survey: The 2MZoA catalogue

 - **Abstract**
 We present a homogeneous 2MASX galaxy catalogue at low Galactic latitudes (|b| <= 10.0 deg, called Zone of Avoidance, ZoA) which is complete to a Galactic extinction-corrected magnitude of Ko <= 11.75 mag. Also included are galaxies at higher latitudes in areas of high foreground extinctions (E(B-V) > 0.95). This catalogue supersedes the previously presented bright 2MZoA catalogue which was only complete to Ko < 11.25 mag. It fully complements the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) galaxy catalogue, which has the same magnitude limit but excludes high extinction regions. The combination of the two catalogues, the extended 2MRS or e2MRS, is is a uniquely whole sky redshift survey and forms a sound basis for studies of large-scale structures, flow fields and extinction across the ZoA. The here presented catalogue comprises 6899 galaxies with 6757 galaxies at low latitudes and 142 galaxies in highly obscured high-latitude areas. The completion rate in redshifts is almost 75%. The catalogue is complete up to star density levels of at least log N_*/deg^2 < 4.3, but the completion rate of the fainter part is affected by foreground extinction at all levels. This can be rectified by using a diameter-dependent extinction correction, adding 1083 highly obscured but apparently faint galaxies (with Ko > 11.75 mag and Ko,d <= 11.75 mag) to the sample. This extended sample shows good completion rates with extinction up to at least AK < 1.3 mag. Omission of such a diameter-dependent extinction correction may lead to a biased flow field even at intermediate extinction values as found in the 2MRS survey. As in our previous investigations, we do not find a dependence of the correction factor f=0.86 to the extinction maps on Galactic longitudes or latitudes, but note a possible influence by cosmic variance.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes produce multi-wavelength emission, of which the optical emission is of ambiguous origin. A unification scenario of tidal disruption events (TDEs) has been proposed to explain the different classes of X-ray and optically selected events by introducing a dependence on the viewing angle and geometry. This work aims to test the unification scenario among optically bright TDEs using polarimetry. By studying the optical linear polarisation of 19 TDEs (of which 9 newly analysed in this work), we place constraints on their photosphere geometry, inclination, and the emission process responsible for the optical radiation. We study how these properties correlate with the relative X-ray brightness. We find that 14/16 non-relativistic events can be accommodated by the unification model. Continuum polarisation levels of optical TDEs lie most often in the range P ~ 1-2% (13 events), and for all except one event, remain below 6%. For those optical TDEs that have multi-epoch polarimetry, the continuum polarisation decreases after peak light for 5/10 events, increases for 3/10 events, and stays nearly constant for 2/10 events. When observed after +70 days (7/16 events), they become consistent with P = 0% within uncertainties (5/7 events). This implies the photosphere geometries of TDEs are at least initially asymmetric and evolve rapidly which, if tracing the formation of the accretion disk, suggests efficient circularisation. The polarisation signatures of emission lines of 7 TDEs directly support a scenario in which optical light is reprocessed in an electron-scattering photosphere. [...] However, a subset of events deviates from the unification model to some extent, suggesting this model may not fully capture the diverse behaviour of TDEs. Multi-epoch polarimetry plays a key role in understanding the evolution and emission mechanisms of TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of 127 gas-bearing dwarf galaxies around 56 late-type host galaxies within 30 Mpc using 21-cm HI data from the WALLABY, MHONGOOSE, and ALFALFA surveys. We characterize the environment of each dwarf galaxy based on its host galaxy halo and derive optical properties using the DESI Legacy Surveys for 110. The gaseous satellites span $\log (M_{\rm HI}/M_{\odot}) = 5.7-9.7$ and $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) = 5.6-10.0$, with a median velocity line-width of $W_{50}=37$ km/s, comparable to the Local Group gaseous dwarf galaxies. We assess the HI mass sensitivity of the data by injecting model dwarf galaxies and find $M_{\rm HI,lim} = 10^{6.7} M_{\odot}$ for WALLABY and $M_{\rm HI,lim} = 10^{5.4} M_{\odot}$ for MHONGOOSE at 10 Mpc. With this sensitivity, our sample shows lower average gas-to-stellar mass ratios ($M_{\rm HI}/M_{\star}$) than literature dwarf galaxy samples. The abundance of gaseous satellites per host is low and increases with host mass: $0-2$ for isolated dwarf galaxy hosts and $0-5$ for Milky Way-mass spiral hosts. These numbers are consistent with the Milky Way, M31, and star-forming satellite abundances from recent deep optical surveys. The inferred quenched fractions and gas-depleted satellites indicate that environmental quenching is effective in Milky Way-mass hosts, likely driven by gas stripping processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Hyper Millennium (HM) simulation, an extremely large cosmological simulation designed to support next-generation galaxy surveys. The simulation follows 4.2 trillion dark matter particles in a comoving box of $2.5\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc}$, with a mass resolution of $3.2 \times 10^8\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and a force resolution of $3.0\ h^{-1}{\rm kpc}$. Its combination of scale and resolution is ideal for studying large-scale structures and rare cosmic objects. In this first paper of the HM project, we explore whether the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (A2744) can be reproduced in detail in the simulation. Pixel-based statistics of galaxy number density $N_{\rm gal}$, luminosity density $L_{\rm gal}$, and projected mass density $\kappa$ show excellent agreement between A2744 and its analogues down to $\sim 50\ {\rm kpc}$, once field-selection biases toward high galaxy surface density are accounted for. This concordance, achieved in one of the most extreme known galaxy environments, is a validation of the underlying $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model in the extreme regime of A2744 and showcases the robustness and accuracy of the HM simulation, which is capable of producing galaxy and mass catalogues of comparable quality out to high redshift across its full comoving volume of $45$ ${\rm Gpc^3}$.
#### Simulating the late stages of WD-BH/NS mergers: an origin for fast X-ray transients and GRBs with periodic modulations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies indicate that mergers of a white dwarf (WD) with a neutron star (NS) or a stellar-mass black hole (BH) may be a potential progenitor channel for certain merger-kind, but long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs), e.g., GRBs 230307A and 211211A. The relatively large tidal disruption radius of the WD can result in non-negligible residual orbital eccentricity ($0 \lesssim e \lesssim 0.2$), causing episodic mass transfer, i.e., repeated tidal disruptions (RPDs) of the WD. We perform smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics simulations of RPDs in sixteen WD-BH/NS systems, capturing the subsequent mass transfer and accretion. The WD undergoes RPDs near the orbital periastron, modulating the ensuing accretion process, leading to variations of the accretion rate on the orbital period. Across all simulations, the peak accretion rates range from $4 \times10^{-4}$ to 0.2 $M_{\odot} \rm \ s^{-1}$, while the RPD duration spans from $\sim$ 10 s to an hour. More compact systems, i.e., those with a higher mass ratio (higher WD mass and lower accretor mass), tend to undergo fewer RPD cycles, resulting in shorter durations and higher accretion rates. If such events can launch relativistic jets, three categories of non-thermal X/$\gamma$-ray transients are predicted, in decreasing order of their mean accretion rates: (1) an X-ray transient with a simultaneous GRB, both lasting for $10^{1-2}$ s; (2) a longer X-ray transient lasting up to $10^{2-3}$ s that has a GRB appearing only at its later phase ; (3) an ultra-long X-ray transient lasting for $\sim 10^{3}$ s without a GRB. A generic feature of these transients is that their prompt emission light curves are probably periodically modulated with periods of a few to tens of seconds.
#### DiffstarPop: A generative physical model of galaxy star formation history

 - **Abstract**
 We present DiffstarPop, a differentiable forward model of cosmological populations of galaxy star formation histories (SFH). In the model, individual galaxy SFH is parametrized by Diffstar, which has parameters $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ that have a direct interpretation in terms of galaxy formation physics, such as star formation efficiency and quenching. DiffstarPop is a model for the statistical connection between $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ and the mass assembly history (MAH) of dark matter halos. We have formulated DiffstarPop to have the minimal flexibility needed to accurately reproduce the statistical distributions of galaxy SFH predicted by a diverse range of simulations, including the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, the Galacticus semi-analytic model, and the UniverseMachine semi-empirical model. Our publicly available code written in JAX includes Monte Carlo generators that supply statistical samples of galaxy assembly histories that mimic the populations seen in each simulation, and can generate SFHs for $10^6$ galaxies in 1.1 CPU-seconds, or 0.03 GPU-seconds. We conclude the paper with a discussion of applications of DiffstarPop, which we are using to generate catalogs of synthetic galaxies populating the merger trees in cosmological N-body simulations.
#### Accretion-Driven Turbulence in the Circumgalactic Medium

 - **Abstract**
 Both observations and hydrodynamic simulations suggest that turbulence is ubiquitous in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We study the development and properties of CGM turbulence driven by accretion in halo masses of $10^{10}-10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at redshifts $0\leq z\lesssim 2$, thus providing a baseline for additional turbulence driving processes such as galaxy feedback. Using analytic considerations and idealized hydrodynamical simulations we demonstrate that in halos with mass up to $\sim10^{12}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, even mild turbulent velocities near the virial radius of $\sigma_{\rm t}(R_{\rm vir})\sim 10\,{\rm km \, s^{-1}}$ are enhanced by the accretion process so that turbulent velocities are comparable to the virial velocity at inner CGM radii, with $\sigma_{\rm t}(0.1\,R_{\rm vir})\approx v_{\rm vir}\sim 100\,{\rm km \, s^{-1}}$. Rapid cooling at these inner radii further implies that thermal pressure support is small, and the gas is dominated by the cool and warm ($\sim10^4-10^5\,{\rm K}$) phases. Inner CGM energetics are thus dominated by turbulence, with gas density distributions and velocity structure functions similar to those seen in simulations of isothermal supersonic ISM turbulence, rather than those seen in subsonically turbulent stratified media such as the ICM. The gas accretion rate in these systems is regulated by the turbulence dissipation rate rather than by the cooling rate as in more massive halos. We argue that galaxy feedback is unlikely to qualitatively change our conclusions unless it continuously injects high specific energy material ($\gg v^2_{\rm vir}$) into the CGM. Such `turbulence-dominated' CGM can be identified in observations via the predicted wide lognormal ionization distributions and large velocity dispersions in UV absorption spectra, particularly in the inner CGM of $\sim L^\star$ and lower-mass halos.
