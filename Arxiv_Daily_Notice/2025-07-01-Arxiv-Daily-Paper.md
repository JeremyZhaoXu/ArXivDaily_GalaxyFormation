 - **Abstract**
 Microquasars, compact binary systems with an accreting stellar-mass black hole or neutron star, are promising candidates for high-energy particle acceleration. Recently, the LHAASO collaboration reported on the detection of $>100$ TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from five microquasars, suggesting that these sources are efficient particle accelerators. In microquasars, high-energy $\gamma$-rays can be produced in large-scale jets or winds. In this work, we explore the X-ray, $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission from SS 433, V4641 Sgr and GRS 1905+105. We consider leptonic and hadronic scenarios to explain the spectra observed by LHAASO and other high-energy $\gamma$-ray detectors. We estimate the neutrino flux associated with the hadronic component and investigate the detectability of neutrinos from these sources in current and future neutrino telescopes. We find that among the three sources, V4641 Sgr has the best prospects of observation with a combined next-generation neutrino telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 We apply a halo velocity bias model, $\gamma_{f}$, within the Aemulus simulation suite for General Relativity (GR) to investigate its efficacy in identifying the signature of assembly bias and Modified Gravity (MG). In the investigation of assembly bias, utilizing galaxy clustering data ranging from scales of $0.1 - 60 \text{Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, we discover that our emulator model accurately recreates the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, along with the velocity bias $\gamma_{f}$, staying well within the 1-$\sigma$ error margins, provided that assembly bias is considered. Ignoring assembly bias can considerably alter our model constraints on parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ if the test sample includes assembly bias. Using our emulator for MG simulations, which encompasses two Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati models (DGP; N1, N5) and two $f(R)$ models (F4, F6), we can effectively identify a robust signature of modified gravity, for models such as DGP-N1 and $f(R)$-F4, as indicated by a noticeable deviation of $\gamma_{f}$ from unity. Using the velocity dispersion of dark matter halos to effectively represent the underlying strength of the velocity field of these MG simulations, we find that the simple $\gamma_{f}$ model can recover the truth with minimal bias. These evaluations indicate that our simple halo-velocity bias model is capable of detecting significant MG characteristics, although additional methodologies should be pursued to improve model constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origin of galactic angular momentum and its connection to the cosmic web remains a pivotal issue in galaxy formation. Using kinematic data from the MaNGA survey, we investigate the alignment between the spin directions of spiral galaxies and their host cosmic filaments. By incorporating filament spin measurements derived from redshift asymmetry across filament spines, we reveal a mass-dependent anti-parallel correlation: low-mass spiral galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot) \lesssim 10$) exhibit a statistically significant anti-parallel alignment between their stellar/gas spins and filament spins, while high-mass spirals show no such trend. Spatial analysis further indicates that high-mass spirals preferentially reside near filament spines, whereas low-mass spirals occupy filament outskirts. These findings extend previous alignment studies that neglected directional spin correlations and provide new insights into how cosmic environments shape galactic angular momentum. The observed anti-parallel trend suggests a critical role for filament spin in regulating the angular momentum acquisition of low-mass spirals. This anti-parallel alignment is significantly enhanced for low-mass spirals residing in dynamically cold filaments, highlighting the importance of filament properties in shaping galaxy spin.

 - **Abstract**
 Maps of cosmic microwave background (CMB) are extracted from multi-frequency observations using a variety of cleaning procedures. However, in regions of strong microwave emission, particularly in the galactic plane from our own galaxy Milky Way and some extended or point sources, the recovered CMB signal is not reliable. Thus, a galactic mask is provided along with the \emph{cleaned} CMB sky for use with that CMB map which excises sky regions that may still be potentially contaminated even after cleaning. So, to avoid bias in our inferences, we impose such a foreground mask. In this paper, we analyze a cleaned CMB map from Planck PR4 to probe for any foreground residuals that may still be present \emph{outside} the galactic mask where the derived CMB sky is considered clean. To that end, we employ a local cross-correlation coefficient statistic where we cross-correlate widely used foreground templates that trace galactic synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission from our galaxy with the cleaned CMB sky. Using simulations, we find that few regions of the derived CMB sky are still contaminated and have to be omitted. Based on this study, we derived a mask that could be used in conjugation with the standard mask to further improve the purpose of galactic masks.
#### Unveiling the Nature and Fate of the Almost-Dark Cloud AGC 226178 through HI Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of extragalactic, almost dark HI clouds with extreme gas-to-stellar mass ratios remains poorly understood. We investigate the nature and fate of the "almost dark" cloud AGC 226178, projected within the Virgo cluster, with an HI-to-stellar mass ratio of ~1000. We present deep single-dish HI mapping from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), complemented by high-resolution interferometric data from the Very Large Array (VLA), as part of the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) project. These observations provide the highest-quality HI analysis to date of such a cloud, combining resolution and sensitivity. FAST data reveal a short, low-velocity tail toward the dwarf galaxy VCC 2034, previously proposed as a possible origin for AGC 226178. However, VCC 2034 shows a line-of-sight asymmetric HI feature and cometary morphology indicating a stripping event unrelated to AGC 226178. VLA data reveal a velocity gradient across AGC 226178 and a clumpy internal structure. The velocity dispersion exceeds the thermal linewidth, implying turbulence or unresolved motions. The cloud cannot be gravitationally bound by atomic gas alone. The resolved HI clumps follow standard HI mass-star formation rate and mass-size relations, with those forming stars reaching surface densities above the threshold for self-shielding. We conclude that AGC 226178 is a free-floating HI cloud of unknown origin. The system appears to be in the process of disintegration. It is likely located well outside the Virgo cluster, as the preservation of its extended HI morphology within the cluster environment would otherwise require a substantial reservoir of unseen molecular gas with a mass exceeding that of the observed HI content. While confinement pressure from the hot intracluster medium may aid its stability, it is unlikely to be the dominant factor preventing its disruption.
#### On the origin of short-lived cocoon in 3C84: powered by tidal disruption events ?

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23317

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23317

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluated the jet power and the density of ambient matter in 3C 84 by using the momentum balance along the jet axis and the transonic condition for the cocoons observed at two different scales (approximately 1 and 6 parsec scales). For the inner cocoon, we precisely determined the ratio of jet power to ambient density $L_{\rm j}/n_{\rm a}$ to be $(0.3-0.7)\times 10^{43}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm cm}^3$. Similarly, for the outer cocoon, we found that this value is more than an order of magnitude larger at $(0.9-3.7)\times 10^{44}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm cm}^3$. This indicates that the outer cocoon is formed by a powerful jet that propagates through an ambient density of $20-300\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$ with a jet power of $10^{45-46.5}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. On the other hand, the inner cocoon is formed by a weaker jet with a power of $10^{43-44}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$, propagating through a relatively low-density environment of $6-20\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$. These results suggest that: 1) with respect to the difference in $n_{\rm a}$, it appears to support the hypothesis that the inner cocoon, recently formed about 10 years ago, is expanding in the low-density cocoon created by the jet emitted about 25-50 years ago. 2) to achieve the short-lived and high $L_{\rm j}$ that generated the outer cocoon, a large mass accretion rate must be required over a short period to activate the jet. These may imply the extreme accretion event driven by the tidal disruption events (TDEs) of massive stars and/or the disk instability.
#### Uncover 3D Dark Matter Distribution of the Milky Way by an Empirical Triaxial Orbit-Superposition Model: Method Validation

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel dynamical model, named empirical triaxial orbit-superposition model, for the Milky Way halo. This model relies on minimal physical assumptions that the system is stationary, meaning the distribution function in 6D phase-space does not change when the stars orbiting in the correct gravitational potential. We validate our method by applying it to mock datasets that mimic the observations of the Milky Way halo from LAMOST + Gaia with stars' 3D position and 3D velocity observed. By removing the stellar disk and substructures, correcting the selection function, we obtain a sample of smooth halo stars considered as stationary and complete. We construct a gravitational potential including a highly flexible triaxial dark matter halo with adaptable parameters. Within each specified gravitational potential, we integrate orbits of these halo stars, and build a model by superposing the orbits together taking the weights of stars derived from the selection function correction. The goodness of the models are evaluated by comparing the density distributions as well as 3D velocity distributions numerically represented in the model to that in the data. The shape and radial density distribution of the underlying dark matter halo can be constrained well simultaneously. We apply it to three mock galaxies with different intrinsic shapes of their dark matter halos and achieved accurate recovery of the 3D dark matter density distributions for all.

 - **Abstract**
 The phase diagrams of ultralight dark matter (DM), modeled as a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate with axionlike interaction, are studied. We classify stable, metastable, and unstable DM states over a wide range of condensate wave function amplitudes. It is shown that the axionlike interaction causes instability and an imaginary speed of sound at low amplitudes, whereas, in a specific high-amplitude band, DM attains a stable state capable of forming a dense solitonic core and suppressing quantum fluctuations in the surrounding galactic DM halo. These findings are corroborated by evaluating thermodynamic functions for DM in the dwarf galaxy NGC2366 and its hypothetical analogs with different core-to-halo mass ratios. Distinct DM phase compositions respond differently to fluctuation-induced partial pressure, resulting in a first-order phase transition in a certain range of an interaction parameter. While the DM properties in NGC2366 lie within the supercritical regime, the phase transition nonetheless provides a thermodynamic marker separating stable from unstable DM configurations. Once a dense core forms - reaching a threshold of about 12% of the total mass - the enhanced gravitation stabilizes the DM halo against fluctuations, while the internal pressure ensures core stability. In particular, we find that NGC2366's dense DM comprises roughly 19% of the DM mass while occupying only 4.7% of its total volume.
#### Enhanced Thermodynamic Framework for Third-Order Galaxy Correlation Functions: From Theory to Observations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23829

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive thermodynamic derivation and observational validation of the third-order galaxy correlation function, extending the seminal work of Iqbal et al [ 1, 2]. Using the statistical mechanics framework for gravitating systems, we derive the governing partial differential equation and provide explicit analytical solutions. Our enhanced framework includes: (1) comparison with N-body simulations and SDSS/BOSS galaxy survey data showing excellent agreement (\c{hi}2/dof = 1.27), (2) systematic methodology for determining model parameters from observational constraints, (3) detailed analysis of scale-dependent behaviour across linear and nonlinear regimes, (4) direct connections to standard cosmological parameters ({\sigma}8, {\Omega}m, fN L), (5) comprehensive treatment of redshift-space distortions, and (6) analysis of observational systematics. We demonstrate that our third-order correlation parameter b3 provides independent constraints complementary to two-point analyses, with potential to break degeneracies in dark energy and modified gravity studies. Explicit quantitative limitations regarding cosmic expansion effects and equilibrium assumptions are provided, along with comparisons to alternative methodologies and extensions for next-generation surveys.
#### Line-of-sight acceleration as a test of the Galactic Yukawa potential

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24002

 - **Abstract**
 We forecast the impact of direct radial acceleration measurements, based on two redshift measurements of the same target one decade apart, on constraining the Yukawa correction to the Newtonian potential in the Milky Way. The Galaxy's matter distribution is modeled as the sum of a spherical bulge, a spherical dark matter halo, and two axially symmetric disks. Considering a sample of 165 Milky Way globular clusters, we find that the precision of next-generation spectrographs ($\sim$ 10 cm s$^{-1}$) is not sufficient to provide competitive constraints compared to rotation curve data using the same baryonic matter distribution. The latter sample only becomes competitive for a precision better than 0.6 cm s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, we find that adopting a population of $1.3 \times 10^5$ RR Lyrae stars as targets, a precision of $\sim$ 10 cm s$^{-1}$ can achieve constraints on the Yukawa parameters as strong as with the rotation curves.
#### The distribution of metals in simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies form due to the continuous accretion of gaseous material towards the centre of dark matter haloes, which gives rise to stellar discs once the gas reaches high density. Analysis of stellar age distribution shows that stars in the inner regions of the disc are born at earlier times, in contrast to those found in the outer regions, which constitute a younger population. This scheme, typical of galactic formation processes, is known as the "inside-out" scenario and is closely related to the global properties of a significant fraction of the population of spiral galaxies. In this study, we analyse model galaxies from the Auriga project, a set of high-resolution, magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, to investigate the distribution of metals at $z=0$. Since different galactic components were subjected to different formation histories, we focus on the distribution of metals in the halo, bulge, and disc using a dynamical decomposition method based on the degree of rotation of the stars and their gravitational potential.
