 - **Abstract**
 We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}}$. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model {\tt{galacticus}} (N-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) $m_{\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.4} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ ($m_{\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.2} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), a 0.4 dex (0.3 dex) improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of $7.4$ and $8.4$ keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos ($10^6 < m/M_{\odot}<10^{10.7}$) of $1.6_{-1.1}^{+2.4} \times 10^7 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$ at $95 \%$ confidence. This is consistent with {\tt{galacticus}} predictions ($0.6 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$), but in tension with recent N-body simulations ($0.3 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$). Our results are the strongest limits on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial extent of the environment's impact on galaxies marks a transitional region between cluster and field galaxies. We present a data-driven method to identify this region in galaxy clusters with masses $M_{200\rm ,mean}>10^{13} M_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$. Using resolved galaxy samples from the largest simulation volume of IllustrisTNG (TNG300-1), we examine how galaxy properties vary as a function of distance to the closest cluster. We train neural networks to classify galaxies into cluster and field galaxies based on their intrinsic properties. Using this classifier, we present the first quantitative and probabilistic map of the transition region. It is represented as a broad and intrinsically scattered region near cluster outskirts, rather than a sharp physical boundary. This is the physical detection of a mixed population. In order to determine transition regions of different physical processes by training property-specific models, we categorise galaxy properties based on their underlying physics, i.e. gas, stellar, and dynamical. Changes to the dynamical properties dominate the innermost regions of the clusters of all masses. Stellar properties and gas properties, on the other hand, exhibit transitions at similar locations for low mass clusters, yet gas properties have transitions in the outermost regions for high mass clusters. These results have implications for cluster environmental studies in both simulations and observations, particularly in refining the definition of cluster boundaries while considering environmental preprocessing and how galaxies evolve under the effect of the cluster environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an overview of the JWST GLIMPSE program, highlighting its survey design, primary science goals, gravitational lensing models, and first results. GLIMPSE provides ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam imaging across seven broadband filters (F090W, F115W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W) and two medium-band filters (F410M, F480M), with exposure times ranging from 20 to 40 hours per filter. This yields a 5$\sigma$ limiting magnitude of 30.9 AB (measured in a 0.2 arcsec diameter aperture). The field is supported by extensive ancillary data, including deep HST imaging from the Hubble Frontier Fields program, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy, and deep JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution multi-object spectroscopy. Exploiting the strong gravitational lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063, GLIMPSE probes intrinsic depths beyond 33 AB magnitudes and covers an effective source-plane area of approximately 4.4 arcmin$^2$ at $z \sim 6$. The program's central aim is to constrain the abundance of the faintest galaxies from $z \sim 6$ up to the highest redshifts, providing crucial benchmarks for galaxy formation models, which have so far been tested primarily on relatively bright systems. We present an initial sample of $\sim 540$ galaxy candidates identified at $6 < z < 16$, with intrinsic UV magnitudes spanning $M_{\mathrm UV}$ = $-$20 to $-$12. This enables unprecedented constraints on the extreme faint end of the UV luminosity function at these epochs. In addition, GLIMPSE opens new windows for spatially resolved studies of star clusters in early galaxies and the detection and characterization of faint high-$z$ active galactic nuclei. This paper accompanies the first public data release, which includes reduced JWST and HST mosaics, photometric catalogs, and gravitational lensing models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present model calculations of the reionization history of hydrogen using star formation histories, computed with a galaxy formation model which reproduces properties of local dwarf galaxies and UV luminosity functions of galaxies at $z=5-16$. We use the ionizing photon density functions predicted by the model along with different models for the escape fraction of ionizing photons, $f_{\rm esc}$, to study the effects of ionizing photons from faint galaxies and different assumptions about $f_{\rm esc}$ on the evolution of hydrogen ionized fraction with redshift, $Q_{\rm HII}(z)$. We show that accounting for the contribution of faint galaxies with UV luminosities $M_{1500}>-13$, and with a constant ionizing photon escape fraction of $f_{\rm esc}=0.1$ results in the hydrogen reionization history consistent with all current observational constraints. Comparing results of the $f_{\rm esc}=0.1$ model and two alternative models shows that the model with a strong luminosity dependence of $f_{\rm esc}$, which assigns high $f_{\rm esc}$ to faint galaxies, results in early reionization inconsistent with observational constraints. However, the model in which $f_{\rm esc}$ follows a universal redshift-independent correlation with the recent maximum specific star formation rate, motivated by the results of the SPHINX galaxy formation simulation, results in the reionization history in good agreement with existing observational constraints, even though this model produces a sizeable ionized hydrogen fraction of $Q_{\rm HII}\approx 0.15-0.2$ at redshifts $z=8-12$. Our results show that the relative contribution of faint dwarf galaxies to reionization depends sensitively on assumptions about the escape fraction for galaxies of different luminosities, and that this is the main source of uncertainty in modeling hydrogen reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way harbours a prominent m=1 lopsided distortion in both stellar and neutral gas distributions. On the other hand, chemo-dynamical studies have been proven to be effective in grasping the overall evolution of galaxies. Here, we investigate systematically the excitation and evolution of a merger-driven $m=1$ lopsidedness in a Milky Way (MW)-like host galaxy, as a function of chemical distribution of stars. Using seven dissipationless, high-resolution $N$-body simulations of minor mergers (between a MW-like host and a satellite) under varying orbital configurations (prograde/retrograde and different orientation of the satellite orbital plane), we first show that a tidal interaction excites a prominent $m=1$ lopsidedness in the stellar density and velocity distribution of the MW-like host. Assigning, a posteriori, metallicities to stellar particles of the MW-like host based on the current observational constraints, we sub-divide the stars into metal-rich ([Fe/H] > 0), metal-intermediate (-0.5 < [Fe/H] <0), and metal-poor (- 0.5 < [Fe/H]) populations. We demonstrate that metal-rich population always show a much stronger $m=1$ lopsidedness in both density and velocity distributions when compared to other two populations. This trend holds true for all minor merger model considered here, regardless of their orbital configurations. Furthermore, minor merger also triggers a transient off-centred stellar disc-dark matter halo configuration, with metal-rich population showing the highest degree of disc-halo offset. We show that the metal-rich population which is kinematically colder (i.e. lower velocity dispersion) by construction, is more susceptible to external perturbations. Lastly, using a catalogue of photometry and metalicity for the LMC, we show that the strength of the $m=1$ distortion (predominantly in the form of an one-arm spiral) in stars increases with metallicity as well.

 - **Abstract**
 The integration of aerodynamic drag is a fundamental step in simulating dust dynamics in hydrodynamical simulations. We propose a novel integration scheme, designed to be compatible with Strang splitting techniques, which allows for the straightforward integration of external forces and hydrodynamic fluxes in general-purpose hydrodynamic simulation codes. Moreover, this solver leverages an analytical solution to the problem of drag acceleration, ensuring linear complexity even in cases with multiple dust grain sizes, as opposed to the cubic scaling of methods that require a matrix inversion step. This new General Implicit Runge-Kutta integrator (GIRK) is evaluated using standard benchmarks for dust dynamics such as DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK. The results demonstrate not only the accuracy of the method but also the expected scalings in terms of accuracy, convergence to equilibrium, and execution time. GIRK can be easily implemented in hydrodynamical simulations alongside hydrodynamical steps and external forces, and is especially useful in simulations with a large number of dust grain sizes.

 - **Abstract**
 We address the origin of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) seen by JWST at cosmic morning ($z \!=\! 4 \!-\! 8$) as compact stellar systems with over-massive black holes (BHs). We propose that LRDs form naturally after feedback-free starbursts (FFB) in thousands of star clusters and following wet compaction. Analytically, we show how the clusters enable efficient dry migration of stars and BHs to the galaxy center by two-body segregation and dynamical friction against the disk. The clusters merge to form compact central clusters as observed. Mutual tidal stripping does not qualitatively affect the analysis. The young, rotating clusters are natural sites for the formation of BH seeds via rapid core collapse. The migrating clusters carry the BH seeds, which merge into central super-massive BHs (SMBHs). Compactions are required to deepen the potential wells such that the SMBHs are retained after post-merger gravitational-wave recoils, locked to the galaxy centers. Using cosmological simulations at different epochs, with different codes and physical recipes, we evaluate the additional growth of LRD-matching compact central stellar systems by global compaction events. Adding to the dry growth by cluster mergers, the compactions can increase the escape velocities to retain the SMBHs. The LRDs appear at $z \!\sim\! 8$, after the formation of FFB clusters, and disappear after $z \!\sim\! 4$ when the stellar mass is above $10^9 M_\odot$ by growing post-compaction blue disks around the nuclear LRDs. The LRD abundance is expected to be $\sim\! 10^{-5} \!-\! 10^{-4}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, increasing from $z \!\sim\! 4$ to $z\!\sim\! 8$.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-field, multi-filter photometric surveys enable the reconstruction of the Milky Way's star formation history (SFH) on Galactic scales and offer new insights into disc assembly. The twelve-filter system of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) is particularly suitable, as its colours trace stellar chemical abundances and help alleviate the age-metallicity degeneracy in colour-magnitude diagram fitting. We aim to recover the SFH of the Galactic disc and separate its chemically distinct components by combining J-PLUS DR3 photometry with Gaia astrometry. We also evaluate the potential of isochrone fitting to estimate stellar ages and metallicities as proxies for evolutionary trends. We fit magnitudes and parallaxes of $1.38\times10^{6}$ stars using a Bayesian multiple isochrone method. The bright region of the colour-absolute-magnitude diagram ($M_{r}\leq4.2$ mag) constrains ages, while the faint region provides an empirical metallicity prior mitigating the age-metallicity degeneracy. Both PARSEC and BaSTI isochrones, in solar-scaled and $\alpha$-enhanced forms, are adopted. The recovered SFH reveals two sequences: an $\alpha$-enhanced population forming rapidly between $12.5$ and $8$ Gyr ago, enriching from [M/H]$\sim-0.6$ to $0.1$ dex; and a solar-scaled sequence emerging $\sim8$ Gyr ago, dominating after $\sim7$ Gyr with slower enrichment reaching solar metallicity by $3$ Gyr. Metal-rich ([M/H]$\gtrsim0$) stars are confined to $\vert z_{GC}\vert\lesssim1$ kpc, whereas metal-poor ([M/H]$\lesssim-0.5$) stars reach $\vert z_{GC}\vert\sim2$ kpc. Simultaneous fitting of both isochrone families reveals distinct formation epochs for the thin and thick discs. J-PLUS multi-filter photometry, combined with Gaia parallaxes, mitigates age-metallicity degeneracies and enables detailed mapping of the Milky Way's temporal and chemical evolution.
#### JWST Lensed Quasar Dark Matter Survey III: Dark Matter Sensitive Flux Ratios and Warm Dark Matter Constraint from the Full Sample

 - **Abstract**
 We present the full sample of measurements of the warm dust emission of 31 strongly-lensed, multiply imaged quasars, observed with JWST MIRI multiband imaging, which we use to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. The strongly lensed warm dust region of quasars is compact and statistically sensitive to a population of dark matter halos down to masses of $10^6$ M$_\odot$. The high spatial resolution and infrared sensitivity of MIRI make it uniquely suited to measure multiply imaged warm dust emission from quasars and thus to infer the properties of low-mass dark halos. We use the measured flux ratios to test for a warm dark matter turnover in the halo mass function. To infer the dark matter parameters, we use a forward modeling pipeline which explores dark matter parameters while also accounting for tidal stripping effects on subhalos, globular clusters, and complex deflector macromodels with $m=1, m=3, \text{ and } m=4$ elliptical multipole moments. Adopting a comparable prior on the projected density of substructure to our previous analyses, the data presented here provide a factor of 2 improvement in sensitivity to a turnover in the halo mass function. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model galacticus we infer with a Bayes factor of 10:1, a half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.8} M_{\odot}$ (m>5.6 keV for a thermally produced dark matter particle). If instead we use a prior from N-body simulations, we infer $m_{\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.5} M_{\odot}$ (m>6.9 keV). This is one of the strongest constraints to date on a turnover on the halo mass function, and the flux ratios and inference methodology presented here can be used to test a broad range of dark matter physics.

 - **Abstract**
 The angular momentum evolution of stars is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of stars and star clusters. Using high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star formation in clouds with different physical properties, we study the initial distribution of stellar rotation periods in young clusters. We compare these results with observations of young Galactic clusters. Simulations qualitatively reproduce the observed trend of increasing rotation period with stellar mass. Additionally, simulations with lower virial parameter (ratio of turbulence to gravity) or solenoidal turbulence driving produce period-mass distributions that more closely match the observed ones. These simulations also recover the break in the mass-period relation. However, the break appears at higher masses than in observations and is absent in the youngest simulated clusters. This suggests that the emergence of the break is an important diagnostic of angular momentum evolution during the earliest stages of cluster formation. The simulations yield stars that rotate about an order of magnitude faster than those observed. This discrepancy mainly reflects the earlier evolutionary stage of the simulations, while unresolved physical interactions between stars and discs might also contribute. This conclusion is supported by simulations showing a significant period increase within 0.1-1 Myr. We quantify the required angular-momentum loss by rescaling simulated rotation periods to match observations, finding that 80-95% of the initial angular momentum must be removed within the first Myr. Our results highlight that understanding the earliest stages of star cluster formation is fundamental to addressing the angular momentum problem.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the distributions of classified young stellar object (YSO) in nine star-forming regions associated with Hii regions, namely Sh2-22, Sh2-19, Sh2-17, M16, M8, IC5070, Sh2-252, NGC2467 and M42, as a means of exploring the star formation scenarios (triggered or spontaneous) in the various regions. The YSO distributions of nine regions along the galactic longitudes and across different spiral arms were explored. It is noted that Sh2-22 and Sh2-19 may have evidence of localized triggered star formation, whereas Sh2-17 may be a spontaneous star forming region. The results showed that the location within the Milky Way may influence localized triggered star formation within individual regions. There is strong evidence that there are fewer older stars (Transition Disks) within the Outer regions of the Galaxy (2.91 +- 1.74%), accompanied by a higher number of Class I (32.49 +- 10.77%). This is different from the Inner Galactic regions where the Transition Disks are higher (32.93 +- 13.78%) as compared to low Class I sources (11.01 +- 4.81%). The number of Class II stars is relatively high and increases from the Inner regions (52.64 +- 10.07%) to Outer regions (64.54 +- 11.09%). These nine star-forming regions are not an accurate representation of locations throughout the Galaxy and the results may be biased.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters can be used as powerful cosmological probes, provided one can obtain accurate mass estimates, which requires a precise knowledge of the underlying astrophysics of galaxy clusters. For these purposes, spatially resolved measurements of the thermodynamic properties of intra-cluster medium (ICM), such as density and temperature, are necessary. In particular, temperature estimates are traditionally obtained through spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy. Such measurements suffer from their sensitivity to the chosen energy calibration, may exhibit inherent biases, and are especially hard to perform at high redshift as they require deep observations. In recent years however, millimetre wavelength data with high spatial resolution, comparable to the one of current X-ray telescopes, have begun to be available. This has enabled the implementation of new methods to infer and map the cluster temperature in individual clusters, using the combination of density maps from X-ray data and pressure maps from millimetre data. In this paper, we present the first systematic validation of this approach on a large sample of synthetic clusters generated in The Three Hundred hydrodynamical simulations. We show that we are able to recover theoretical estimates of the temperature, namely the mass-weighted and spectroscopic-like temperatures, within biases of the order of $\lesssim 1\%$ in the best cases, up to $\sim 10\%$ in average, with scatters of the order of $10\%$. To prepare the application of this approach to observed data, we discuss the modelling of the effective length $l_\mathrm{eff}$, a key quantity necessary for the combination of X-ray and SZ projected data. In particular we provide templates calibrated on simulations for this quantity, and investigate their impact in the recovery of the temperature map, compared to other standard models.

 - **Abstract**
 Connecting the formation and evolution of galaxies to the large-scale structure is crucial for interpreting cosmological observations. While hydrodynamical simulations accurately model the correlated properties of galaxies, they are computationally prohibitive to run over volumes that match modern surveys. We address this by developing a framework to rapidly generate mock galaxy catalogs conditioned on inexpensive dark-matter-only simulations. We present a multi-modal, transformer-based model that takes 3D dark matter density and velocity fields as input, and outputs a corresponding point cloud of galaxies with their physical properties. We demonstrate that our trained model faithfully reproduces a variety of galaxy summary statistics and correctly captures their variation with changes in the underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters, making it the first accelerated forward model to capture all the relevant galaxy properties, their full spatial distribution, and their conditional dependencies in hydrosimulations.

 - **Abstract**
 $\textit{Context.}$ There is considerable debate on how massive stars form, including whether a high-mass star must always form with a population of low-mass stars or whether it can also form in isolation. Massive stars found in the field are often considered to be runaways from star clusters or OB associations. However, there is evidence in the Milky Way and the Small Magellanic Cloud of high-mass stars that appear isolated in the field and cannot be related to any known star cluster or OB association. Studies of more distant galaxies have been lacking so far. $\textit{Aims.}$ In this work, we identified massive star candidates that appear isolated in the field of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4242 (distance: 5.3 Mpc), to explore how many candidates for isolated star formation we find in a galaxy outside the Local Group. $\textit{Methods.}$ We identified 234 massive ($M_{ini}\geq15M_{\odot}$) and young ($\leq 10$ Myr) field stars in NGC 4242 using the Hubble Space Telescope's Solar Blind Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys, the UVIS channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 from the Galaxy UV Legacy Project (GULP) and optical data from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). We investigated the surroundings of our targets within the range of projected distances expected for runaway stars, $74$ pc and $204$ pc. $\textit{Results.}$ We find that between $9.8\%$ and $34.6\%$ of our targets have no young stellar groups or massive stars within the threshold radii, making them appear isolated. This fraction reduces to $3.2\%-11.5\%$ when we consider the total number of massive stars expected from the observed UV star formation rate. $\textit{Conclusions.}$ Our results show that there is a small population of young and massive, potentially isolated field stars in NGC 4242.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that dark stars, which are dark-matter-powered stars in the early universe, can grow by accretion to masses in the range $\mathscr{O}\left ({10}^4\right )-\mathscr{O}\left ({10}^7\right)\,{M_\odot}$ before the general-relativistic Feynman-Chandrasekhar instability causes their dynamical collapse to black holes. These accreting dark star configurations avoid standard stellar nuclear- and weak-interaction evolution that would lead to their demise long before they reached this supermassive size. Remarkably, this mechanism for supermassive black hole (SMBH) genesis is relatively robust to initial dark star mass, formation epoch, accretion rate and its history. The SMBHs produced this way can serve as seeds for even larger SMBHs $({\gtrsim}10^9\,M_\odot)$ that have been discovered at high redshift.
