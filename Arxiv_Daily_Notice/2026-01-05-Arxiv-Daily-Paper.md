 - **Abstract**
 From the Eagle project, we study the properties of galaxies hosting AGN in cosmic voids and their surrounding structures, filaments and walls, at $z=0$, comparing them to non-AGN galaxies in similar environments. We found that the AGN fraction decreases as a function of void-centric distance, with void galaxies displaying the highest AGN fraction (12\%), and galaxies in denser environments, showing the lowest AGN fraction (6.7\%), consistent with observations. The AGN fraction is particularly high in most massive void galaxies when controlling for stellar mass. When comparing AGN host galaxies to inactive ones, we find that AGN galaxies tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs, higher specific star formation rates, and reside in higher-mass haloes at a given stellar mass than non-AGN galaxies. At $\rm M_{*} > \rm 10^{10.2} \rm M_{\odot}$, AGN hosts in voids tend to have slightly more massive SMBHs than those in denser environments. Otherwise, the AGN population does not show a clear trend in relation to the global environment. In contrast, non-AGN void galaxies host more massive SMBHs, slightly higher sSFRs, and are located in more massive haloes than those in denser environments. Analysing the recent merger histories of both AGN and non-AGN populations, we find that a larger fraction of massive AGN galaxies have undergone major mergers compared to non-AGN galaxies, regardless of environment. Notably, AGN galaxies in voids show a higher frequency of recent mergers, especially major mergers, than their counterparts in other environments, especially at high stellar mass. Our results suggest that the evolution of SMBHs in voids is closely related to that of their host galaxies and their surrounding environment, while the most recent AGN activity is more strongly linked to recent interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark energy (DE) remains elusive, even though it constitutes the dominant energy-density component of the Universe and drives the late-time acceleration of cosmic expansion. By combining measurements of the expansion history from baryon acoustic oscillations, supernova surveys, and cosmic microwave background data, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has inferred that the DE equation of state may evolve over time. The profound implications of a time-variable, ``dynamical" DE (DDE) that departs from a cosmological constant motivate the need for independent observational tests. In this work, we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation to investigate how DDE affects the properties of the Lyman-Alpha ``forest'' of absorption features produced by neutral hydrogen in the cosmic web. We find that DDE models consistent with the DESI constraints induce a spectral tilt in the forest transmitted flux power spectrum, imprinting a scale- and redshift-dependent signature relative to standard Lambda-CDM cosmologies. These models also yield higher intergalactic medium temperatures and reduced Lyman-Alpha opacity compared to Lambda-CDM. We discuss the observational implications of these trends as potential avenues for independent confirmation of DDE.
#### Callisto's Nonresonant Orbit as an Outcome of Circum-Jovian Disk Substructure
 - **Authors:** Teng Ee Yap, Konstantin Batygin

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

 - **Abstract**
 The Galilean moons of Io, Europa, and Ganymede exhibit a 4:2:1 commensurability in their mean motions, a configuration known as the Laplace resonance. The prevailing view for the origin of this three-body resonance involves the convergent migration of the moons, resulting from gas-driven torques in the circum-Jovian disk wherein they accreted. To account for Callisto's exclusion from the resonant chain, a late and/or slow accretion of the fourth and outermost Galilean moon is typically invoked, stalling its migration. Here, we consider an alternative scenario in which Callisto's nonresonant orbit is a consequence of disk substructure. Using a suite of N-body simulations that self-consistently account for satellite-disk interactions, we show that a pressure bump can function as a migration trap, isolating Callisto and alleviating constraints on its timing of accretion. Our simulations position the bump interior to the birthplaces of all four moons. In exploring the impact of bump structure on simulation outcomes, we find that it cannot be too sharp nor flat to yield the observed orbital architecture. In particular, a "Goldilocks" zone is mapped in parameter space, corresponding to a well-defined range in bump aspect ratio. Within this range, Io, Europa, and Ganymede are sequentially trapped at the bump, and ushered across it through resonant lockstep migration with their neighboring, exterior moon. The implications of our work are discussed in the context of uncertainties regarding Callisto's interior structure, arising from the possibility of non-hydrostatic contributions to its shape and gravity field, unresolved by the Galileo spacecraft.
