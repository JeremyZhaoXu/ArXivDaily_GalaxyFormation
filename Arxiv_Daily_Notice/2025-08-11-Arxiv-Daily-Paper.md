 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams around the Milky Way (MW) can provide valuable insights into its history and substructure formation. Previous studies have suggested that several MW streams could have an origin related to that of the disc of satellite galaxies (DoS) and the young halo globular clusters of the MW, given that many of these structures present a similar orbital pole orientation. In this work we test the validity of this hypothesis by revising the orbital pole distribution of the MW streams with the latest stream dataset (galstreams). For a sample of 91 streams at Galactocentric distances of $d<100$ kpc we find that the pole distribution has no preferred orbital direction. However, as we subtract the streams closer to the Galactic centre, by imposing several lower distance cuts, we find that the larger the Galactocentric distance of the streams, the higher the fraction of stream poles pointing in a direction similar to the DoS. This trend could be explained if the stream pole distribution were originally anisotropic, but precession effects displaced the orbital poles of the streams closer to the Galactic centre. From the pole distribution and the estimated precession rates of the streams in the sample, we infer that the streams nearer the Galactic centre are indeed quite likely to be affected by precession. Finally, we corroborate with hydrodynamical simulations that, even in a scenario in which the MW substructures had a common origin, an overdensity in their orbital pole direction cannot be appreciated until the selected sample also includes material at $d \gtrsim 150$ kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 Current and upcoming cosmological surveys will produce unprecedented amounts of high-dimensional data, which require complex high-fidelity forward simulations to accurately model both physical processes and systematic effects which describe the data generation process. However, validating whether our theoretical models accurately describe the observed datasets remains a fundamental challenge. An additional complexity to this task comes from choosing appropriate representations of the data which retain all the relevant cosmological information, while reducing the dimensionality of the original dataset. In this work we present a novel framework combining scale-dependent neural summary statistics with normalizing flows to detect model misspecification in cosmological simulations through Bayesian evidence estimation. By conditioning our neural network models for data compression and evidence estimation on the smoothing scale, we systematically identify where theoretical models break down in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate a first application to our approach using matter and gas density fields from three CAMELS simulation suites with different subgrid physics implementations.
#### Excavating The Ruins: an Ancient $z=2.675$ Galaxy Which Formed in the First 500 Myr

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of an ancient galaxy at $z=2.675$ which we dub ``Eridu.'' Simultaneously modeling the JWST/NIRSpec G140M and G235M spectra from the SMILES program and $0.4-25\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ HST, JWST/NIRCam, and JWST/MIRI photometry from the the JADES+SMILES photometric catalogs shows that Eridu is massive and quiescent with stellar mass $\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})=10.96^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and average star formation rate $<1\ \mathrm{M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$ over the last 100 Myr. Star formation histories inferred from various models produce disconcertingly early and fast formation within $\sim300$ Myr of the Big Bang and quenching 2 Gyr prior to observation ($z\sim10$). This stellar mass assembly implies that the progenitor of Eridu had $M_*\approx10^{11}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z>10$, nearly two orders of magnitude more than the most massive current high redshift observations. From Eridu's spectrum we infer $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} =+0.65^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$, indicating its stellar population is extremely $\alpha$-enhanced, which is consistent with the rapid formation timescale inferred from its star formation history. Eridu inhabits a massive protostructure which offers additional explanations for rapid mass assembly and quenching via environmental mechanisms, e.g. major mergers. Though its inferred formation is at odds with observations of the brightest cosmic dawn galaxies, we anticipate that future high-redshift galaxy formation models and sophisticated stellar population modeling codes will unearth how Eridu formed at the dawn of time.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray photons substantially affect the thermal and ionization states of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), thereby significantly influencing the 21-cm line observables such as its sky-averaged (global) brightness temperature. Nevertheless, the complicated dependency of astrophysical processes on a broad spectrum of parameters, including X-ray efficiency, spectral characteristics, and gas dynamics, makes precisely simulating the effect of X-ray flux challenging. Traditional approaches, including N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, are computationally intensive and struggle to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces efficiently. We present a stacked hybrid model trained on a specific simulation intended to reconstruct the effect of X-ray flux on the global 21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR. Along with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this architecture combines two substantial forms of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), therefore enabling fast adaptation to several X-ray flux levels. Without demanding repeated simulations, this emulator preserves temporal and spatial dependencies and generalizes to unseen parameter combinations. This matter reduces computation time by a factor of one million while preserving excellent prediction accuracy of 99.93\%, facilitating studies on high-dimensional parameter inference and sensitivity with an error margin of less than 0.35 mK. Our LSTM-GRU-CNN emulator combines recurrent and convolutional architectures to enable a robust and scalable analysis of X-ray heating effects on the global 21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR.
#### Mergers Fall Short: Non-merger Channels Required for Galactic Heavy Element Production

 - **Abstract**
 Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated kilonova, neutron star mergers have been established as a key production channel for $r$-process elements in the Universe. However, observations of $r$-process abundances as inferred from stellar spectra of Milky Way disk stars, together with chemical evolution modeling, suggest that additional channels are needed to fully account for the $r$-process element enrichment in the Milky Way. Neutron star-black hole mergers and fast-merging binary neutron star systems are among the leading alternative candidates. In this study, we combine gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with data from short gamma-ray bursts, Galactic pulsars, and Galactic [Eu/Fe] vs [Fe/H] abundance observations to assess the contribution of these mergers to $r$-process enrichment in the Galactic disk. We find that neither neutron star-black hole mergers nor fast-merging binary neutron star populations can serve as the dominant additional channel without generating strong tension with existing observations and theoretical expectations. These results constrain the viable sources of Galactic $r$-process enrichment and underscore the necessity of non-merger production channels.
#### Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess morphology of dark matter in simulations of the Milky Way galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 The strongest experimental evidence for dark matter is the Galactic Center gamma-ray excess observed by the Fermi telescope and even predicted prior to discovery as a potential dark matter signature via WIMP dark matter self-annihilations. However, an equally compelling explanation of the excess gamma-ray flux appeals to a population of old millisecond pulsars that also accounts for the observed boxy morphology inferred from the bulge old star population. We employ a set of Milky Way-like galaxies found in the Hestia constrained simulations of the local universe to explore the rich morphology of the central dark matter distribution, motivated by the GAIA discovery of a vigorous early merging history of the Milky Way galaxy. We predict a significantly non-spherical gamma-ray morphology from the WIMP interpretation. Future experiments, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array, that extend to higher energies, should distinguish between the competing interpretations.
#### Revisiting the Gas Dynamics of Henize 2-10: Possible Drivers of the Starburst

 - **Abstract**
 The triggers of starburst episodes are a key component to our understanding of the baryon cycle in galaxies. Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested catalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single kinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to assess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to dominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such dwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which appears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst episode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy itself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA 21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the dynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an HI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995), which was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these new observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI appears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a tidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of some type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of available results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the starburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could be falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.
