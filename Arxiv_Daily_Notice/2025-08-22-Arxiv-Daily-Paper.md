 - **Abstract**
 Context: Recent studies using Gaia data have reported tidal tail detections for tens to hundreds of open clusters. However, a comprehensive assessment of the reliability & completeness of these detections is lacking. Aims: This work aims to summarise the expected properties of tidal tails based on N-body simulations, review the reliability of tidal tail detections in the literature, and grade them according to a set of diagnostic tests. Methods: We used a grid of 68-20000 Msun simulated clusters & analysed the formation & evolution of the tails. We compiled 122 catalogues (58 unique clusters) from literature, within 500 pc of the Sun. We employed tests based on photometric, morphological & dynamical signatures, & comparisons with simulations, to grade their tails. Results: Based on the simulations, we analysed the complex morphology of the tails & their properties (e.g., size, span, stellar types, number density, & mass function) at various cluster masses & ages. During the first 200 Myr of evolution, the tails typically form a characteristic S shape, with an amplitude that scales with cluster mass. The tail span increases at a rate of 4 times the initial velocity dispersion, & the near-tail is predominantly populated by recent escapees. Conclusions: In the 122 published tail catalogues, we found that 15 gold & 55 silver catalogues passed the majority of the tests. The remaining 51 were graded as bronze; care should be taken before using these for further analysis. The age, metallicity, binary fraction, & mass function of stars in the tails were generally consistent with those of their parent clusters. The gold/silver catalogues (69 catalogues of 40 clusters) represent reliable samples for detailed analyses of tails. Future data will be essential for further validation & for leveraging tidal tails as tracers of cluster dissolution & the Galactic potential.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies reside in extended dark matter halos, but their baryonic content, especially dust, remains less well understood. We aim to investigate the amount and distribution of dust in galactic halos by measuring shifts in the observed magnitudes of background galaxies. Dust absorbs and scatters shorter-wavelength light, reddening background sources. We quantify this effect using multi-band magnitude shifts in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 4, distinguishing it from achromatic magnification. Our pipeline is validated using MICE2 mock catalogues, and we explore potential systematics arising from galaxy selection, in contrast to previous quasar-based studies. Simulations show that input halo and dust masses can be recovered independently and jointly using galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) and magnitude shifts. A minimum redshift separation of $\Delta z_{\mathrm B}\sim0.3$ and brightness cuts are required to minimise overlap effects and the effects of photometric noise, respectively. Applying our pipeline to KiDS data, we first confirm the achromaticity of magnitude shifts in five near-infrared filters ($ZYJHK_{\rm s}$). In optical bands ($ugri$), joint analysis constrains halo mass and dust mass to $0.2$ dex and $0.3$ dex, respectively, yielding $M_{\rm dust}=7.24^{+0.52}_{-0.64} \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ and $\log(M_{\rm halo}^{\rm DM}/M_\odot)=12.33^{+0.08}_{-0.04}$. These results agree with previous studies and represent the first successful measurement of magnitude shifts and halo extinction with KiDS, confirming that galaxies reside in extended baryonic halos enriched by gas and dust from feedback processes.
