 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation radio telescopes will provide unprecedented data volumes of the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution across cosmic time. Combining weak lensing surveys with spatial and kinematic observations of HI could help constrain key properties of dark matter, such as its mass, clustering behavior, and spatial distribution. However, inferring dark matter properties from HI observations is challenging because of processes related to galaxy formation, such as stellar feedback. Methods that use empirical relations, often calibrated via numerical simulations, do not use full field-level information to model the complex relation between dark matter and HI. We address this shortcoming with a data-driven approach, leveraging the recently introduced EMBER-2 model to learn the HI-dark matter mapping at the field level for a wide redshift range, z=6-0. After training on cosmological galaxy formation simulations run with FIRE-2, EMBER-2 accurately recovers key statistics, including dark matter mass fractions and surface density profiles. The HI-dark matter density cross-correlation is reconstructed at an accuracy of 10% down to scales of k = 100 h/cMpc, a significant improvement over traditional approaches. The presented method may become a key ingredient in future inference pipelines as it can be readily integrated into downstream analysis tasks of radio surveys.
#### Explaining ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at $3 < z < 5$ in the context of their environments

 - **Abstract**
 The swift assembly of the earliest galaxies poses a significant challenge to our understanding of galaxy formation. Ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshifts ($3 < z < 5$) currently present one of the most pressing problems for theoretical modeling, since very few mechanisms can be invoked to explain how such galaxies formed so early in the history of the Universe. Here, we exploit the fact that these galaxies all reside within significant overdensities to explain their masses. To this end, we construct and release a modified version of the Extreme Value Statistics (EVS) code which takes into account galaxy environment by incorporating clustering in the calculation. With this new version of EVS, we find that ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at $3<z<5$ do not present as serious a tension with simple models of galaxy formation when the analysis of a given galaxy is conditioned on its environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The nuclear transient eRASSt J012026.5-292727 (J012026 hereafter) was discovered in the second SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS2). The source appeared more than one order of magnitude brighter than the eRASS1 upper limits (peak eRASS2 0.2-2.3 keV flux of 1.14 x 10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1), and with a soft X-ray spectrum (photon index Gamma = 4.3). Over the following months, the X-ray flux started decaying, with significant flaring activity on both hour- and year-timescales. By inspecting the multiwavelength light curves of time-domain wide-field facilities, we detected a strong mid-infrared flare, evolving over 2 years, and a weaker optical counterpart. Follow-up optical spectroscopy revealed transient features, including redshifted Balmer lines (FWHM ~1500 km/s), strong Fe II emission, He II and Bowen lines, and high-ionization iron coronal lines. One spectrum showed a triple-peaked H-beta line, consistent with emission from a face-on elliptical disk. The spectroscopic features and the slow evolution of the event place J012026 within the classifications of Bowen fluorescence flares (BFFs) and extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs). BFFs have been associated with rejuvenated accreting SMBHs, although the mechanism triggering the onset of the new accretion flow is still unclear, while ECLEs have been linked to the disruption of stars in gas-rich environments. The association of J012026 to both classes, combined with the multi-wavelength information, suggests that BFFs could be, at least in some cases, due to tidal disruption events (TDEs). The observed X-ray variability, uncommon in standard TDEs, adds complexity to these families of nuclear transients. These results highlight the diverse phenomenology of nuclear accretion events and demonstrate the value of systematic X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA and Einstein Probe, for uncovering such transients and characterizing their physical origin.
#### Equivalence of the field-level inference and conventional analyses on large scales

 - **Abstract**
 We study a simple setup with dark matter halos in real space, with the amplitude of the linear density field $A$ as the only free cosmological parameter. We show that Eulerian perturbation theory is adequate for describing this system on large scales, compute the leading $n$-point functions and perform a joint power spectrum, bispectrum and trispectrum analysis. Beyond the bispectrum which is crucial for breaking the degeneracy between $A$ and the linear bias, we find that addition of the trispectrum reduces the error on $A$ by only $20-30\%$. Our results for the joint analysis are in good agreement with recent field-level analyses in the same setup. This implies that the field-level inference on large scales does not get significant information from large displacements beyond those in Eulerian kernels or higher-order $n$-point functions beyond the trispectrum. We provide further evidence for this showing that the dependence of the error bars on the maximum wavenumbers used in the analysis is the same in the two approaches. Our results are in disagreement with some of the recent joint power spectrum and bispectrum analyses using likelihood-free inference based on perturbative forward modeling. We discuss a possible origin of this discrepancy and highlight the importance of resolving it in order to have the optimal results in cosmological analyses based on perturbation theory.
#### The PARADIGM project II: The lifetimes and quenching of satellites in Milky Way-mass haloes

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance and star-formation histories of satellites of Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies are linked to their hosts' assembly histories. To explore this connection, we use the PARADIGM suite of zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations of MW-mass haloes, evolving the same initial conditions spanning various halo assembly histories with the VINTERGATAN and IllustrisTNG models. Our VINTERGATAN simulations overpredict the number of satellites compared to observations (and to IllustrisTNG) due to a higher $M_{*}$ at fixed $M_{\rm halo}$. Despite this difference, the two models show good qualitative agreement for both satellite disruption fractions and timescales, and quenching. The number of satellites rises rapidly until $z=1$ and then remains nearly constant. The fraction of satellites from each epoch that are disrupted by $z=0$ decreases steadily from nearly 100% to 0% during $4>z>0.1$. These fractions are higher for VINTERGATAN than IllustrisTNG, except for massive satellites ($M_{*}>10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$) at $z>0.5$. This difference is largely due to varying distributions of pericentric distance, orbital period and number of orbits, in turn determined by which sub(haloes) are populated with galaxies by the two models. The time between accretion and disruption also remains approximately constant over $2>z>0.3$ at $6-8$ Gyr. For surviving satellites at $z=0$, both models recover the observed trend of massive satellites quenching more recently ($<8$ Gyr ago) and within $1.5\,r_{\rm 200c}$ of the host, while low mass satellites quench earlier and often outside the host. Our results provide constraints on satellite accretion, quenching and disruption timescales, while highlighting the convergent trends from two very different galaxy formation models.
#### The intra-cluster light as estimator of the cluster's mass profile

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The intra-cluster light (ICL) comprises stars that are unbound to individual galaxies within a galaxy cluster and provides insights into the cluster's mass distribution, evolutionary history and dynamical state. Aims. We aim to study the viability of the intra-cluster stellar mass as a proxy to compute the total mass profiles of galaxy clusters. Methods. High-resolution simulations from the C-EAGLE project are used to study the ratio between intra-cluster stellar mass and total matter projected densities. This ratio follows a power-law, and a model is presented for its fit parameters and associated errors. Results. The aforementioned relation is used to estimate the mass profile of the Perseus cluster using Euclid observations that extend up to 1/3 of the virial radius. The obtained cluster mass is compatible with other measurements from galaxy velocity dispersion, though it is overestimated by a factor 2 compared to X-ray mass estimates. We repeat this process for four clusters in the Hubble Frontier Fields, finding compatibility with weak and strong lensing mass estimates. Conclusions. This methodology provides an independent approach to cluster mass estimation based solely on observed ICL and a simulation-calibrated relation.
#### Constructing a Pristine View of Extended Globular Cluster Structure

 - **Abstract**
 Globular Clusters (GCs) displaying extended structures are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the Milky Way (MW). Despite their low surface brightness, which makes disentangling the true structure from the MW overwhelmingly difficult, the increasing availability of multi-dimensional data sets has allowed for new detections of extended GC structure. This work utilises the Pristine-Gaia-Synthetic catalogue released as part of the Pristine Surveys first data release to search for tidally stripped stars in the peripheries of MW GCs. Pristine provides photometric [Fe/H] measurements based on CaHK-band photometry. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, we provided lists of extra-tidal stars for 30 GCs, one of the largest surveys of its kind. We find that (1) 22 GCs that passed our quality cut have extended structure within 5 deg from the cluster centers of which six are new tentative detections, (2) four of those GCs exhibit diffuse envelope-like extra-tidal features, while the remaining GCs exhibit tidal tail-like structures. We measure the position angles of the extended structures, find broad consistency between the position angles and the GC orbits, and discuss our results concerning N-body models. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of adding photometric metallicities to the multi-dimensional search of extended tidal structure and how the upcoming multi-object spectrographs will be crucial for exploring GC peripheries in the coming years.
#### N-body simulations of galaxy bars generated by satellite collisions: effects of the impact geometry

 - **Abstract**
 Bars, a common and important structure in disk galaxies, can be induced by galaxy interactions. Although there have been some studies on bar formation in flybys or collisions, the vast parameter space still leaves many scenarios that require further investigation. Here, we focus on the role of collisions caused by small galaxies (denoted as intruders), referred to as satellite collisions, in bar formation for MW/M31-like galaxies (denoted as target galaxies). Multiple sets of simulations with varying intruder initial velocities, inclination angles, collision positions, and intruder masses were run to study the dependence of this mechanism on these parameters. Our simulations show that bar formation favors moderate collision velocity, large inclination angle, off-center collision position, and large intruder mass. However, the bar's pattern speed and length are insensitive to these parameters, as the intruder's mass is relatively small compared to that of the target galaxy itself. Moreover, based on our tests, the intruder mass should be more than $\sim 3\times10^{9}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ in order for this bar formation mechanism to operate effectively in MW/M31-like galaxies. Our work suggests the possibility that satellite collisions may have contributed, to some extent, to the bar formation in the Milky Way or M31.
#### Polarization-shape alignment of IllustrisTNG star-forming galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 In star-forming disk galaxies, the radio continuum emission (1-10 GHz) powered by star formation has an integral polarization direction imperfectly aligned with the apparent disk minor axis. This polarization-shape alignment effect was previously observed in a small sample of local spirals. If this is prevalent for disk galaxies out to cosmological redshifts, novel measurements of cosmic birefringence and cosmic shear will be enabled by leveraging radio continuum surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array synergized with galaxy shape measurements. We calculate the polarization-shape misalignment angle for star-forming galaxies in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation at 0 < z < 2, assuming that additional polarized radio emission from an active galactic nucleus is negligible in at least a sizable fraction of the star-forming galaxies. The alignment found for z = 0 is consistent with local spiral data, but significantly deteriorates as redshift increases. Moreover, it degrades toward lower frequencies due to internal Faraday depolarization. Thanks to cosmic redshifting, observing higher-z galaxies at a fixed frequency greatly mitigates degradation due to reduced Faraday depolarization at the source-frame frequency. We present analytic fits to the non-Gaussian misalignment angle distribution, and evaluate Fisher information per galaxy for measuring a polarization rotation angle induced by cosmic birefringence. For observation at 4.8 GHz, the effective root-mean-square misalignment angle is 18°, 23°, and 33° at z = 0, 1 and 2, respectively. As accurate observation-driven models are not yet available for cosmological galaxy samples, our results motivate pilot observations to empirically characterize polarization-shape alignment, and can facilitate forecasts of cosmology and fundamental physics applications that exploit this effect.
