 - **Abstract**
 A critical step to create realistic mock catalogs that support large-scale photometric and spectroscopic sky surveys is the production of cosmological simulations that accurately model the survey observables taking into account the redshift-dependent galaxy formation and evolution processes. Here we develop an efficient framework, HOLCon (Halo Optimised Lightcone Constructor), for post-facto construction of dark matter halo lightcones from simulations and use them to generate a mock galaxy catalogue. HOLCon includes a module to optimise the lightcone's orientation within the simulation box, minimising repeated structures when the survey volume exceeds a single box -- a common challenge in modern surveys. A linear interpolation scheme tracks the evolution of halo properties across snapshots. Applied to the publicly available Uchuu simulation, we construct a lightcone of 50 ${\rm deg}^2$ and extending up to $z = 10$, providing representative coverage of deep fields of Stage IV surveys. We validate the lightcone for cosmological applications by comparing the dark matter halo clustering in the lightcone with those from the original simulation snapshots. Subsequently, we make the galaxy-halo connection on the lightcone with a redshift extended version of the SciPIC algorithm producing a comprehensive set of descriptive galaxy attributes. HOLCon leverages Dask, a scalable parallel computing pythonic framework for fast construction of dark matter halo lightcones enabling rapid creation of multiple statistical realizations essential for robust cosmological inference. The produced galaxy mock makes predictions for clustering of H$\alpha$ emitters, making it a useful cosmology resource.
#### Buried but not destroyed: the evolution from prompt cusps to NFW haloes

 - **Abstract**
 The internal structure of dark matter haloes encodes their assembly history and offers critical insight into the nature of dark matter and structure formation. Analytical studies and high-resolution simulations have recently predicted the formation of 'prompt cusps' - steep power-law density profiles that emerge rapidly from the monolithic collapse of primordial peaks. Yet, by $z=0$ most haloes are well described by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles, raising the question of how these early cusps are transformed in a cosmological setting. We address this problem using 64 zoom-in $N$-body simulations of eight haloes, each resimulated with eight different free-streaming wavenumbers to control the abundance of small-scale structure while keeping the large-scale environment fixed. To mitigate numerical discreteness effects, we classify artificial fragments and genuine subhaloes with a physically motivated procedure based on matching subhaloes to their progenitor peaks. At the population level, we demonstrate that haloes initially form prompt cusps, and their profiles subsequently transition towards the NFW form. Our study reveals three distinct pathways by which prompt cusps evolve: major mergers, accretion of artificial fragments, and interactions with large-scale filaments, each having a distinct impact on the inner density profile. In particular, we show that the original power-law cusp remains visible in the profile of particles associated with the primordial peak even when the total halo profile is already NFW-like. This work highlights the imprint of early collapse on present-day halo structure and provides new insights into the origin of the universality of the NFW profile.
#### Connection between galaxy morphology and dark-matter halo structure II: predicting disk structure from dark-matter halo properties

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how galactic disk structures connect to the detailed properties of their host dark-matter halos using the TNG50 simulation. From the hydrodynamic and matched dark-matter-only runs, we measure a comprehensive list of halo properties describing density structure, angular momentum, shape, assembly history, and environment. Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \le z \le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses between roughly $10^2\,M_\odot$ and $10^5\,M_\odot$, represent a largely uncharted component of the black-hole (BH) population. They are theoretically predicted to form in several early-Universe pathways, including the remnants of massive Population III stars, the runaway collapse of dense stellar clusters, and the direct collapse of metal-poor gas. Establishing whether IMBHs are present in dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way (MW), and with what occupation fraction - i.e. the fraction of galaxies with a certain stellar mass that host a central BH - provides one of the most incisive tests of BH seed formation models. Despite their importance, present dynamical constraints on IMBHs remain weak. Dynamical IMBH masses or upper limits are available for very few such systems, with secure detections in less than ten cases. A next-generation wide-field spectroscopic facility, capable of combining deep multiplexed stellar spectroscopy with high-resolution integral-field observations of galaxy centers, would open access to IMBH masses in the $\leq10\,M_\odot$ regime. Such an advance would make possible - for the first time - a robust measurement of the IMBH occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. A key scientific requirement for the coming decades is to establish the observational and instrumental capabilities needed to detect or tightly constrain IMBHs in nearby dwarf galaxies, particularly in the $\simeq10^3-10^4 \,M_\odot$ mass range, and thereby enable a measurement of their occupation fraction. Such a measurement is fundamental for distinguishing between competing scenarios for the formation of BH seeds in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetospheres of neutron stars in the Galactic Center provide an exceptional environment to search for dark matter axions through their resonant conversion into photons. The combination of extreme magnetic fields and high dark matter density in this region creates ideal conditions for axion-photon conversion across the centimetre-to-submillimetre wavelength range. Detecting the cumulative emission from these neutron star populations demands a facility with unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution, and broad frequency coverage in the submillimetre domain, capabilities essential to explore a previously inaccessible region of axion parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 Submillimetre molecular lines (e.g., CO, HCN, SiO) provide a uniquely powerful view of the physical and chemical processes that govern star formation (SF) and galaxy evolution. Yet, our current picture of the molecular universe beyond the Milky Way remains strikingly incomplete: broad chemical inventories exist for only a handful of galaxies, typically more extreme than the Milky Way, constrained by sensitivity limits and narrow survey strategies. In the 2040s, surveying galaxies with multi-species, multi-transitions observations across diverse galactic environments will be crucial to establish effective chemical diagnostics of the various ISM processes from the early universe to $z=0$. Extragalactic astrochemistry provides a uniquely sensitive probe of the physical processes shaping galaxies, allowing us to understand, species by species, how gas responds to its local environment and how galaxies grow, transform, and recycle matter over cosmic time.
#### AtLAST -- Determination of Halo Mass Density Profiles at kpc Scales through Magnification Bias

 - **Abstract**
 Magnification bias, the lensing-induced modification of background source number counts, provides a uniquely powerful probe of the mass density profiles of galaxies and clusters down to kpc scales. Unlike shear-based weak lensing, magnification bias does not rely on galaxy shapes and thus avoids dominant small-scale systematics. Existing studies, however, are limited by sky coverage, positional uncertainty, and insufficiently deep, confusion-limited submillimetre (submm) surveys. A next-generation wide-field, high-throughput submm facility like the proposed 50m-telescope AtLAST is required to unlock this technique's full diagnostic power.
#### Cold Gas Infall onto A Brightest Group Galaxy via A Gas-Rich Minor Merger

 - **Abstract**
 Dust and cold gas are not uncommon in nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs), and represent an important aspect of their evolution. However, their origin has been debated for decades. Potential sources include internal processes (e.g., mass loss from evolved stars), external mechanisms (e.g., minor mergers or cooling flows), or a combination of both. Gas-rich minor mergers have long been proposed as an important channel for cold gas fueling in both observations and simulations, but direct evidence of cold gas transportation via gas-rich minor mergers remains elusive, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters where environmental effects are prevalent. In this letter, we present the first unambiguous case of direct cold gas transportation onto a brightest group galaxy (BGG) at $z=0.25$, driven by an ongoing close-separation gas-rich minor merger with a mass ratio of $\sim1:56$. High-resolution JWST imaging reveals a heavily obscured, low-mass satellite that is barely visible at restframe optical wavelengths. Tidal stripping from this satellite deposits gas and dust onto the BGG, forming prominent $\sim$10 kpc dust lanes in situ. Cosmological simulations indicate that such interactions preferentially occur in gas-rich satellites undergoing their first infall in highly eccentric orbits. Our results highlight the pivotal role of gas-rich minor mergers in replenishing cold gas reservoirs and shaping the evolution of central ETGs in galaxy groups.
#### From ASTRID to BRAHMA -- The role of overmassive black holes in little red dots in cosmological simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We leverage the overmassive black holes ($\rm M_{BH}/M_{\ast} \approx0.1$) present in a realization of the BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite to investigate their role in the emission of the unique ``little red dot'' (LRD) objects identified by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be $\rm 2.04 \pm 0.32 \times 10^{-4} \space Mpc^{-3}$, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation ($\rm A_V = 0.21 \pm 0.12$), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently identified Abell 2744-QSO1 as a compact, metal-poor, black hole (BH) dominated galaxy at $z\simeq 7$. This system exhibits an extreme black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; $M_{\rm BH}=5\times10^7\,M_\odot$) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population~III/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to $z\lesssim 10$, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates ($\dot{m}_{\rm BH}/\dot{m}_{\rm edd} \sim 1-10\%$), subsolar metallicities ($Z/Z_\odot\lesssim10^{-2}$) and extreme $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered "little red dots".

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the multiphase gas within the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles is crucial for understanding Galactic Center (GC) feedback. We use HI4PI data to investigate the kinematics and physical properties of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) toward the GC. Our results reveal that the HVCs exhibit a distinct asymmetric distribution, closely associated with the bar-driven tilted dust lanes and the distorted overshooting streams. We propose that powerful nuclear outflows interact with these gas-rich, off-plane structures, striping and entraining cold gas from the outer Galactic regions (R_GC~0.5--1.7 kpc) rather than solely from the region of the central molecular zone (CMZ; R_GC<0.3 kpc). In this scenario, as the Galactic bar drives gas inflows along the dust lanes, nuclear outflows simultaneously break through the CMZ, sweeping up and ablating cold gas from the boundary layer of these pre-existing structures. This process naturally accounts for the observed high turbulence, complex spectral signatures, and anomalous spatial-kinematic gas patterns, as well as multiwavelength asymmetries of the bubbles. The HVCs are accelerated to about 230--340 km/s over a dynamical time of ~3--6 Myr. When the multiphase, inhomogeneous composition of the gas is included, the estimated gas outflow rate reaches ~1 Msun/yr. This value is comparable to the bar-driven inflow rate, indicating a tightly coupled gas cycle in the inner Galaxy. Our research highlights the critical role of bar-driven gas dynamics and nuclear feedback in the secular evolution of the Milky Way, offering a valuable paradigm for investigating gas cycles in external galaxies.
#### Vertically resolved minimal-set k-distribution for thermal infrared absorption in the Venus atmosphere

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14120

 - **Abstract**
 The original k-distribution technique is applied to parameterize absorption of thermal radiation in the lower and middle atmosphere of Venus. It is developed for modeling scenarios in which the cost of full radiative transfer calculations necessitates the use of efficient and simplified parameterizations, such as climate modeling. Line-by-line reference modeling based on a Monte Carlo radiative transfer method is embedded into the construction of the k-terms, providing explicit control over accuracy. Using 16 spectral bands spanning 10--6000 cm^{-1}, the method produces 32 k-terms and 16 per-band spectral points for computing Venus cloud optical properties. Vertical resolution of the resulting k-terms is a key advantage, as it avoids the inter-level correlation assumption inherent to the correlated-k method. Height-dependent k(z) functions are supplied on the same vertical grid as the input temperature-pressure profile, enabling direct use in radiative transfer solvers and eliminating the need for vertical interpolation. The implementation yields plausible accuracy below 90 km, with cooling-rate errors of about 1 K day^{-1} and flux errors below 1 percent, while reducing the number of k-terms by a factor of approximately 2.5--3 relative to typical correlated-k approaches. A Fortran driver for generating k(z) functions for arbitrary Venus atmospheric profiles is provided in a public repository.
#### Can dwarf spheroidal galaxies host a central black hole ?

 - **Abstract**
 We construct mass models of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies to place constraints on the central black hole (BH) masses they can host. We model the galaxies as a three-component system consisting of the stars, dark matter halo, and a central black hole, using the Osipkov--Merritt--Cuddeford class of anisotropic distribution function. The posterior distribution of black hole mass remains flat toward the low-mass end, indicating that the kinematic data places an upper limit on the black hole mass. Our analysis yields a 95% credible upper limit of $\log(M_{\bullet}/M_{\odot}) < 6$. We combine our results with black hole mass measurements and upper limits from the literature to construct a unified $M_{\bullet}$--$\sigma_{}$ relation spanning $\sigma_{} \sim 10$--$300,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$, described by $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 8.32 + 4.08,\log\left(\sigma_{}/200,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}\right)$, with an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_{\rm int} = 0.55$. We compare the inferred limits to models of black hole growth via momentum-driven accretion and stellar capture, which predict black hole masses in the range $10^{3}$--$10^{4},M_{\odot}$ for the range $\sigma_{} \sim 6$--$12,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$, in close agreement with the $M_{\bullet}$--$\sigma_{*}$ relation within the 95% credible upper limits on the black hole masses derived in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 (Sub-)millimeter spectral lines can be used not only to understand the chemical complexity and enrichment history of an observed portion of our Galaxy, but with spectrally resolved lines, they reveal the physical conditions, dynamics, and even the ionisation state and magnetic field strengths of the gas component of our Galaxy. They are prime tracers of mass assembly and structure formation across scales.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way (MW) is our unique laboratory to test star formation theories at the level of individual stars, serving as the Rosetta Stone to interpret extragalactic observations. The proposed White Paper focuses on the following key questions regarding the structure and evolution of the MW traced by young stellar populations: Q1. How do large-scale dynamical instabilities, like warps and vertical waves, drive the star formation of the Galactic thin disk? Q2. Do star-forming regions form stochastically, driven by local self-propagating feedback, or are they triggered by a common dynamical process acting on Galactic scales? Do internal feedback loops and external interactions tend to sustain or quench star formation in the MW? Q3. Are the clustered star-forming regions the only environments where stars form, or can stars also form in more diffuse structures such as the stellar strings?

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the dynamical state of galaxy clusters influences their galaxy populations and mass distributions. Using photometrically selected clusters from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey cross-matched with the UNIONS galaxy shear catalogue, we classify clusters as evolved or evolving based on their rest-frame r-band magnitude gaps and stellar mass ratios between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and bright satellites. We measure the stellar mass functions, weak-lensing profiles, and radial number density and red-fraction profiles of stacked clusters in both subsamples. Evolved clusters exhibit more concentrated lensing profiles, bimodal stellar mass functions dominated by massive BCGs, and a deficit of intermediate-mass satellites, while evolving clusters show flatter central lensing signals and an excess of massive satellites. Applying the same selection to IllustrisTNG clusters reproduces these trends and links the observed differences to distinct mass accretion histories. These results demonstrate the close link between cluster galaxy populations and the overall dynamical state of their underlying dark matter halo.

 - **Abstract**
 With large numbers of transients discovered by current and future imaging surveys, machine learning is increasingly applied to light curve and host galaxy properties to select events for follow-up. However, finding rare types of transients remains difficult due to extreme class imbalances in training sets, and extracting features from host images is complicated by the presence of bright foreground sources, particularly if the true host is faint or distant. Here we present a data augmentation pipeline for images and light curves that mitigates these issues, and apply this to improve classification of Superluminous Supernovae Type I (SLSNe-I) and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with our existing NEEDLE code. The method uses a Similarity Index to remove image artefacts, and a masking procedure that removes unrelated sources while preserving the transient and its host. This focuses classifier attention on the relevant pixels, and enables arbitrary rotations for class upsampling. We also fit observed multi-band light curves with a two-dimensional Gaussian Process and generate data-driven synthetic samples by resampling and redshifting these models, cross-matching with galaxy images in the same class to produce unique but realistic new examples for training. Models trained with the augmented dataset achieve substantially higher purity: for classifications with a confidence of 0.8 or higher, we achieve 75% (43%) purity and 75% (66%) completeness for SLSNe-I (TDEs).

 - **Abstract**
 Milky Way analogues (MWAs) are usually selected from structural and kinematic properties, but robust SED-based similarity criteria are limited by heterogeneous photometry and incomplete wavelength coverage. We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC~3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects. Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014--2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\sim2^{\prime\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture. The preferred fit yields $M_\star \simeq 6.0\times10^{10},M_\odot$, ${\rm SFR}\simeq1.65,M_\odot,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, $M_{\rm dust}\simeq1.3\times10^{8},M_\odot$, and an effective dust temperature of $\sim23$~K. The decameter constraint gives $S_{28,{\rm MHz}}<11.22$~Jy, consistent with expectations for a Milky Way-like system placed at 10.7~Mpc. We conclude that an integrated, homogeneous SED, especially below 100~MHz, provides a complementary diagnostic for identifying and validating MWAs and for interpreting how Milky Way properties would appear to an external observer.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) can be established not only via exquisitely precise pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements, but also via astrometric observations. Indeed, the very same background responsible for the delay in the arrival time of pulse causes an apparent displacement of galactic objects as stars and asteroids. In this work we provide a framework that allows to derive the displacement of sources overcoming the usually adopted ``infinite distance'' approximation. We also present how this formalism can be used to study the displacements of objects at distances comparable to the GW wavelength, as asteroids, and of objects with a non-trivial three-dimensional distribution, as stars in the Milky Way. Thus, it can be used to probe frequencies beyond PTA experiments, reaching the mHz GWs, also detectable by LISA. We forecast the capability of observing the astrometric deflection induced by a GWB evaluating the harmonic signal-to-noise ratio including correlations between different probes. We find an SNR greater than one for the relevant cases considered and as a consequence a promising Fisher forecast, suggesting a constraining power up to the percent level for a flat background.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the effect of Light (but Massive) Relics (LiMRs) on the clustering of matter in the early Universe. We account for the fact that LiMRs which are massive enough may cluster on large length scales at early times, and may thus impact weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) even on small angular scales. In particular, we find that LiMRs in the $\gtrsim$ eV mass range (and even $> 10$ eV), can constitute a non-negligible component of dark matter. This opens up a class of scenarios in which energy is injected as dark radiation, but begins to redshift as matter before recombination, thus avoiding constraints on $\Delta N_{eff}$ while providing an eV-range dark matter component.

 - **Abstract**
 A recent study of the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B using JWST-NIRSpec IFU kinematics confirmed a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass $M_{BH}=3.6\pm0.7\times10^8$ (~8% of the stellar mass). In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a ~16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain ~50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q>0.15 and a recoil kick of ~340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within ~30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics.
