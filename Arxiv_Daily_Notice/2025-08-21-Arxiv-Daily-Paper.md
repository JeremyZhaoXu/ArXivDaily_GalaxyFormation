 - **Abstract**
 We review participatory science programs that have contributed to the understanding of star formation. The Milky Way Project (MWP), one of the earliest participatory science projects launched on the Zooniverse platform, produced the largest catalog of ``bubbles'' associated with feedback from hot young stars to date, and enabled the identification of a new class of compact star-forming regions (SFRs) known as ``yellowballs'' (YBs). The analysis of YBs through their infrared colors and catalog cross-matching led to discovering that YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects embedded in clumps that range in mass from 10 - 10,000 solar masses and luminosity from 10 - 1,000,000 solar luminosities. The MIRION catalog, assembled from 6176 YBs identified by citizen scientists, increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass SFRs by nearly two orders of magnitude. Ongoing work utilizing data from the Spitzer, Herschel and WISE missions involves analyzing infrared color trends to predict physical properties and ages of YB environments. Methods include applying summary statistics to histograms and color-color plots as well as SED fitting. Students in introductory astronomy classes contribute toward continued efforts refining photometric measurements of YBs while learning fundamental concepts in astronomy through a classroom-based participatory science experience, the PERYSCOPE project. We also describe an initiative that engaged seminaries, family groups, and interfaith communities in a wide variety of science projects on the Zooniverse platform. This initiative produced important guidance on attracting audiences that are underserved, underrepresented, or apprehensive about science.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past 15 years, the evidence has clearly demonstrated that massive black hole (MBH) binary merger timescales depend strongly on the structural and kinematic properties of their host galaxy. Stellar density, gas content, shape and kinematics all play a role, combining in non-linear ways to effect the evolution of the binary. The binary properties themselves, such as eccentricity, mass ratio, and orbital plane, all matter as well. This makes it nontrivial to estimate accurate cosmological MBH binary merger rates, or to generate merger rate ranges that reflect the distribution of galaxy hosts and orbits. Using an extensive set of high-resolution direct N-body simulations in which the shape, structure, and kinematics of each galaxy host are directly informed by observations, we map out MBH binary merger timescales over a range of galaxy hosts and MBH binary orbits. This yields a convenient set of scaling relations to determine MBH binary merger timescales -- and the range of merger timescales -- as functions of basic observables. Such scaling relations can be readily employed as a subgrid model in cosmological or semi-analytic studies, for example, to model event rates for LISA or pulsar timing.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron stars (BNSs) are among the most interesting sources for multimessenger studies. A number of recently discovered BNSs in the Milky Way by radio telescopes have added new information to the parameter distribution of the Galactic BNSs. The scarce of BNS mergers during the O4 run of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) suggests a BNS local merger rate six times lower than the previous constraint obtained by O1-O3 runs. With these new multimessenger observations, in this letter, we adopt the compact binary population synthesis model and Bayesian analysis to constrain the formation and evolution of BNSs, especially the common envelope (CE) evolution. We find that it is required: (1) a fraction ($f_{\rm HG}\sim0.8$) but not all of the Hertzsprung gap donors merged with their companions in the CE stage, in order to simultaneously explain the low BNS merger rate density and the existence of the short-orbital-period ($\lesssim 1$ day) Galactic BNSs, different from either all ($f_{\rm HG}=1$) or none ($f_{\rm HG}=0$) adopted in previous studies; (2) a large CE ejection efficiency $\alpha$ ($\sim 5$), in order to explain the existence of the long-orbital-period ($\gtrsim 10$ day) Galactic BNSs.
#### The oldest tidally induced bar-like galaxy in the IllustrisTNG cluster

 - **Abstract**
 New JWST observations have revealed the presence of a significant number of high-redshift barred galaxies. The origin of these bars remains unclear, and their properties appear difficult to reconcile with the results of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. I present an example of a tidally induced bar-like galaxy formed at z = 2.9 in the TNG100 suite of the IllustrisTNG simulations. The galaxy was identified among the sample of bar-like galaxies studied before and has the earliest bar formation time among the tidally induced subsample of those objects. Its disk transformed into a bar as a result of a close interaction with a massive progenitor of a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). It remained on a tight orbit around the host and survived until the present, losing most of its initial mass and becoming red but preserving its prolate shape. Even before the interaction, at z = 3.5, the galaxy experienced a few mergers, which elongated its shape. This temporary distortion also made it look like a bar with spiral extensions of up to 6 kpc. The long-lived bar formed later was about 3 kpc long and grew over the next few gigayears. This example demonstrates that high-z bars should not be sought among the progenitors of present-day simulated barred galaxies but rather among the tidally interacting early population of galaxies in forming groups and clusters. Some of these galaxies may have survived as ellipticals, and some may have merged with their BCGs.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of stellar bars in 307 Milky Way-mass disc galaxies in the TNG50 cosmological simulation. Most bars form rapidly in dynamically cold discs shortly after the central stellar mass exceeds that of dark matter. In these cases, bar formation is consistent with secular instabilities driven by the disc's self-gravity, which organises stellar orbits into a coherent bar structure. However, around 25 per cent of barred galaxies are dark matter dominated at the time of bar formation, $t_{bar}$, and remain so thereafter. We trace the origin of these bars to tidal perturbations induced by passing satellites or mergers using a new metric, $S_{bar}$, quantifying the tidal field acting on the galaxy. At the time of bar formation, we find a negative correlation between $S_{bar}$ and the central stellar-to-dark matter mass fraction, indicating that more dark matter-dominated discs require stronger tides to trigger bar formation. These tidally induced bars are more likely to be transient than those that form secularly, although bar properties are otherwise similar. However, the host galaxies differ: secular bars arise in relatively compact discs, while tidal bars appear in extended discs whose properties resemble those of unbarred galaxies. Tidal perturbations can therefore induce bars in galaxies otherwise stable to secular formation, highlighting the dual role of the internal galactic structure and the external environment in bar formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the third installment of the Alma Luminous Star (ALS) catalogue, aimed at creating the most comprehensive and clean sample of Galactic massive stars. This update extends the sample by adding approximately 2000 OB stars, incorporating astrometric and photometric data from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) alongside spectroscopic information from the Galactic O-Star Catalog based on recent ground-based spectroscopic surveys. Rigorous astrometric corrections are applied to Gaia DR3 parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry, ensuring accurate distance estimates through a Bayesian method suited to this stellar population's spatial distribution in the Milky Way. We perform some comparative analyses highlighting the improved distance accuracy over previous versions, underscore the importance of precise spectral classifications with competing catalogues, and identify areas for improvement in Gaia DR3 effective temperature and extinction estimates for massive stars. We also address the challenges of having robust definitions for these objects. In addition, we explore the catalogue's ability to trace Galactic features such as spiral arms, spurs and OB associations (with some insights on the nature of Gould's Belt). Finally, we discuss the potential for further expanding the sample with upcoming surveys. This effort marks a significant advancement in the creation of a reliable census of Galactic massive stars, contributing to our understanding of the Milky Way's structure and star formation history. This catalogue should serve as a valuable reference for the massive star community, supporting research on stellar interiors, winds, stellar feedback, and other processes that make OB stars key to the evolution of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates the initial mass and chemical evolution history of the Gaia-Enceladus dwarf galaxy. We combine spectroscopic data from APOGEE with astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to identify Gaia-Enceladus candidate stars via a machine-learning pipeline using t-SNE and HDBSCAN. By focusing on kinematic and chemical parameters, especially $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$, $\mathrm{[Al/Fe]}$, and $\mathrm{[Mn/Fe]}$, we uncover a population of metal-poor, high-eccentricity stars that align with literature criteria for Gaia-Enceladus debris. We then apply the \textit{OMEGA+} chemical evolution model, incorporating MCMC fitting of the observed abundance trends in the $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]\times[Fe/H]}$ plane. Our best-fitting model indicates a gas mass of $4.93_{-0.72}^{+0.32}\times10^9\,{M_{\odot}}$ for Gaia-Enceladus, placing it at the higher end of previously suggested mass ranges. The model scenario suggests a short star formation timescale, substantial outflows, and a rapid build-up of metals mainly driven by core-collapse supernovae, with a lesser contribution from Type~Ia supernovae. Comparison with observational data in other chemical planes (e.g., $\mathrm{[Mg/Mn]\times[Al/Fe]}$) supports this scenario, emphasizing a distinct evolution path relative to the Milky Way. Additionally, our results provide indirect evidence that star formation in Gaia-Enceladus likely ceased within the first 4 Gyr, consistent with earlier inferences of an early merger event. These findings highlight the power of chemical evolution modeling in reconstructing the origin and mass of ancient accreted systems. Overall, we show that Gaia-Enceladus, through a rapid star formation and strong outflows, contributed a significant fraction of the metal-poor stellar halo of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope recently uncovered a population of massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years after the Big Bang. Among these high-redshift BH candidates, observations have identified a class of active galactic nuclei candidates, dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs), with extraordinarily compact gas reservoirs and peculiar spectral features. LRDs clearly emerge at redshift z<8 and their abundance declines by z<5. Recent theoretical studies have explored the link between LRDs and the formation of heavy BH seeds in the early Universe, such as direct-collapse BHs (DCBHs). Here we present results from preliminary runs for the MELIORA cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, where we implement an accurate model for DCBH formation, accounting for the Lyman-Werner radiation field and mass-inflow rates in the target host haloes. We aim to test whether or not DCBH formation could lead to systems resembling those hypothesized for LRDs. We find that the population of newly formed DCBHs in the simulations exhibits a steep decline at z<6, akin to the emergence of LRDs, primarily driven by reduced inflows. The birth of DCBHs is associated with a significant gas compaction event, followed by a phase of intense luminosity in the 200 Myr after their birth, and subsequently by the formation of the first PopIII stars in these very haloes. If these DCBHs nurseries are associated with LRDs, then it could explain their weak emission from X-rays and hot dust.
