 - **Abstract**
 Observations of extreme starbursts, often located in the cores of protoclusters, challenge the classical bottom-up galaxy formation paradigm. Giant elliptical galaxies at $z=0$ must have assembled rapidly, possibly within few 100 Myr through an extreme growth phase at high-redshift, characterized by elevated star-formation rates of several thousand solar masses per year distributed over concurrent, gas-rich mergers. We present a novel view of the $z=4.3$ protocluster core SPT2349$-$56 from sensitive multi-cycle ALMA dust continuum and [CII]158$\mu$m line observations. Distributed across 60 kpc, a highly structured gas reservoir with a line luminosity of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}=3.0\pm0.2\times10^9$ $L_\odot$ and an inferred cold gas mass of $M_{gas}= 8.9\pm0.7\times10^{9}$ $M_\odot$ is found surrounding the central massive galaxy triplet. Like ``beads on a string'', the newly-discovered [CII] streamers fragment into a few kpc-spaced and turbulent clumps that have a similar column density as local Universe spiral galaxy arms at $\Sigma_{gas}=20$--$60$ $M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. For a dust temperature of 30 K, the [CII] emission from the ejected clumps carry $\gtrsim$3% of the FIR luminosity, translating into an exceptionally low mass-to-light ratio of $\alpha_\mathrm{[CII]}=2.95\pm0.3$ $M_\odot$ $L_\odot^{-1}$, indicative of shock-heated molecular gas. In phase space, about half of the galaxies in the protocluster core populate the same caustic as the [CII] streamers ($r/r_{vir}\times|\Delta v|/\sigma_{vir}\approx0.1$), suggesting angular momentum dissipation via tidal ejection while the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is assembling. Our findings provide new evidence for the importance of tidal ejections of [CII]-bright, shocked material following multiple major mergers that might represent a landmark phase in the $z\gtrsim4$ co-evolution of BCGs with their hot, metal enriched atmospheres.
#### Via Machinae 3.0: A search for stellar streams in Gaia with the CATHODE algorithm

 - **Abstract**
 We apply the model-agnostic anomaly detection method Cathode - originally developed for particle physics - to search for stellar streams in Gaia data. We combine Cathode with Via Machinae 3.0: a re-optimized version of the stellar stream detection method that was previously applied to Gaia data together with the related anomaly detection technique Anode. We demonstrate that the combination of Via Machinae 3.0 with Cathode, called VM3-C, not only re-discovers previously known streams, but also confirms many candidate streams identified in combination with Anode (denoted VM3-A). Compared to VM3-A, the number of stream candidates detected by VM3-C increases by around 10%. Moreover, both of the methods discover the same two large clusters of stream candidates in the Northern Galactic hemisphere. We dub these highly significant anomalous structures the Raritan stream and the Passaic stream. These two structures may indicate the presence of larger objects, such as dwarf galaxy streams, or non-trivial orbital dynamics resulting in bifurcation or fanning, and are promising and high-priority targets for further analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass transfer between stars in binary systems profoundly impacts their evolution, yet many aspects of this process (especially the stability, mass loss, and eventual fate of such systems) remain poorly understood. One promising avenue to constrain these processes is through the identification and characterisation of systems undergoing active mass transfer. Inspired by the slow brightening preceding stellar merger transients, we worked on a method to identify Galactic mass-transferring binaries in which the donor is a Hertzsprung gap (HG) star. We constructed an initial sample of HG stars using the Gaia EDR3 contribution Starhorse catalogue, and we identified candidate mass-transferring systems by selecting sources that exhibit Balmer emission features (using the low-resolution Gaia XP spectra), mid-infrared excess (from WISE photometry), and photometric variability (inferred from the error in the Gaia G-band magnitude). This multi-criteria selection yielded a sample of 67 candidates, which we further analysed using complementary photometric and spectroscopic data. Among our candidates, we identified at least nine eclipsing binaries and some sources that are potential binaries as well. Three sources in our sample are strong candidates for mass-transferring binaries with a yellow component, and three more are binaries with a Be star. Notably, four sources in our sample are strong candidates for hosting a compact companion, based on their UV or X-ray signatures. The main sources of contamination in our search are hot but highly reddened stars (primarily Oe and Be stars). As an additional outcome of this work, we present a refined catalogue of 308 bona fide HG stars, selected using improved extinction corrections and stricter emission-line criteria. This enhanced sample is expected to contain a significantly higher fraction of scientifically valuable mass-transferring binaries.
#### An improved model for the effect of correlated Si-III absorption on the one-dimensional Lyman-$α$ forest power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of Si-III absorption and its effect on the 1D Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum using the Sherwood-Relics hydrodynamical simulation suite. In addition to the well-understood oscillations arising from the Ly$\alpha$--Si-III cross correlation, we find an enhancement in small-scale power that has been ignored in previous studies. We therefore develop a new analytical fitting function that captures two critical effects that have previously been neglected: distinct Ly$\alpha$ and Si-III line profiles, and a variable ratio for coeval Ly$\alpha$ and Si-III optical depths. In contrast to earlier work, we also predict amplitudes for the Si-III power spectrum and Ly$\alpha$--Si-III cross power spectrum that decrease toward lower redshift due to the hardening metagalactic UV background spectrum at $z\lesssim 3.5$. The fitting function is validated by comparison against multiple simulated datasets at redshifts $2.2\leq z \leq 5.0$ and wavenumbers $k < 0.2\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$. Our model remains in good agreement with earlier work at large scales ($k \lesssim 0.06\rm\,s\,km^{-1}$) and it has little effect on existing warm dark matter constraints from the Ly$\alpha$ forest when adopting a physically motivated prior on the silicon abundance. It will, however, be an essential consideration for future, high-precision Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum measurements.
#### The Small Magellanic Cloud through the lens of the James Webb Space Telescope : binaries and mass function within the galaxy outskirts

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the fraction of binary systems are fundamental ingredients that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies. Whether the IMF is universal or varies with environment remains one of the central open questions in astrophysics. Dwarf galaxies such as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), with their low metallicity and diffuse star-forming regions, offer critical laboratories to address this issue. In this work, we exploit ultra-deep photometry from the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the stellar populations in the field of the SMC. Using the $m_{\rm F322W2}$ versus $m_{\rm F115W}-m_{\rm F322W2}$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD), we derive the luminosity function and measure the fraction of unresolved binary systems. We find a binary fraction of $f_{\rm bin}^{q>0.6}=0.14\pm0.01$, consistent with results from synthetic CMDs incorporating the metallicity distribution of the SMC. Additionally, the measured binary fraction in the SMC field is consistent with those observed in Galactic open clusters and Milky Way field stars of similar ages and masses, suggesting similar binary formation and evolutionary processes across these low-density environments. By combining the luminosity function with the best-fit isochrone, we derive the the mass function (MF) down to $0.22\,M_{\odot}$, the lowest mass limit reached for the SMC to date. The resulting MF follows a power-law with a slope of $\alpha=-1.99\pm0.08$. This value is shallower than the canonical Salpeter slope of $\alpha=-2.35$, providing new evidence for IMF variations in low-metallicity and low-density environments.
#### Parity Violation in Galaxy Shapes: Primordial Non-Gaussianity

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA) as a probe of parity-violating primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we show that the parity-odd IA power spectrum is sensitive to the collapsed limit of the parity-odd primordial trispectrum. For a $U(1)$-gauge inflationary model, the IA power spectrum is proportional to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation, $P_\zeta(k) \propto k^{-3}$. However, the proportionality constants contain not only the PNG amplitude but also undetermined EFT bias parameters. We use $N$-body simulations to determine the bias parameters for dark matter halos. Using these bias parameters, we forecast IA's constraining power, assuming data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that the IA power spectrum can improve the current limits on the amplitude of parity-violating PNG derived from galaxy four-point correlation and CMB trispectrum analyses. Moreover, galaxy shapes are complementary to these probes as they are sensitive to different scales and trispectrum configurations. Beyond galaxy shapes, we develop a new method to generate initial conditions for simulations and forward models from the parity-odd trispectrum with an enhanced collapsed limit.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of abundant post-starburst/quiescent galaxies just $\sim$1-2 Gyrs after the Big Bang challenges our current paradigm of galaxy evolution. Cosmological simulations suggest that quasar feedback is likely the most promising mechanism responsible for such rapid quenching. Here we report a high detection rate (6/27) of exceptionally fast and powerful galaxy-scale outflows traced by [O III] emission in z $\sim$ 5-6 luminous quasars as revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with velocity up to $\sim$8400 km s$^{-1}$ and order-of-magnitude kinetic energy outflow rates up to $\sim$260% the observed quasar bolometric luminosities. This fraction is $\gtrsim$6.6 times larger than that in luminosity-matched comparison samples at z $\sim$ 1.5-3.5 (0/58) and z $<$ 1 (5/148). These extreme outflows are comparable to or even faster than the most rapid [O III] outflows reported at z $\lesssim$ 3, and could reach the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or even the intergalactic medium (IGM). The average kinetic energy outflow rate of our entire sample is $\sim$230$\times$ higher than that at cosmic noon. The substantially higher frequency of outflows with energetics well above the threshold for negative feedback in our sample strongly suggests that quasar feedback plays a significant role in efficiently quenching/regulating early massive galaxies.
