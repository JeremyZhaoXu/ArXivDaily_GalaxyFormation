 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of two low-mass, high-redshift, quiescent galaxies, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy alongside NIRCam and MIRI photometry. Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of $\rm 10^{9.6}M_\odot$ and $\rm 10^{9.5}M_\odot$, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive ($\sim10\times$ lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation ($z\sim 7$) and has a formation redshift of around z$\sim$11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation ($z\sim6$). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z "mini-quenched" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass $z>5$ quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.

 - **Abstract**
 [Shortened for arXiv] We conduct a systematic search for $\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 9.5$ quiescent galaxies at $z > 3$ in six extragalactic deep fields observed with NIRCam, with the goal of extracting their physical and statistical features in a uniform and self-consistent manner. We exploit the ASTRODEEP-JWST photometric catalogs to single out robust candidates, including sources quenched only a few tens of Myr before the observation. We apply a SED-fitting procedure which explores three functional forms of star formation history and the $\chi^2$ probabilities of the solutions, with additional checks to minimise the contamination from interlopers, tuning our selection criteria against available spectroscopic data from the DAWN archive and simulated catalogs. We select 633 candidates, which we rank by a reliability parameter based on the probabilities of the quiescent and alternative star-forming solutions, with 291 candidates tagged as "gold". According to the best-fit models, 79\% of the massive ($\log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \geq 10.5$) quiescent galaxies at $3 < z < 5$ stopped forming stars at least 150 Myr before the time of observation, while 89\% of low-mass sources have been quenched for less than 150 Myr. The abundance of low-mass old quiescent systems does not increase significantly with time from $z = 5$ to 3: low-mass objects seem to be experiencing a short episode of quenching followed by rejuvenation (``breathing''), consistent with a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. We also find an abrupt drop in the density of massive quiescent candidates at $z > 5$. We derive estimates for the number density of early passive galaxies up to $z = 10$ and compare them against various models: tensions with data remain in the modeling of the observed bimodality of time passed since quenching as a function of mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent efforts to identify secondary variations in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) have primarily focused on simulations examining the role of large-scale cosmic environments such as superclusters, filaments, and underdense regions or voids. If present, these variations could yield valuable insights into galaxy formation mechanisms, halo assembly processes, and the influence of external factors on cosmic structure. We aim to test whether secondary trends in the HOD driven by the large-scale structure of the Universe are detectable observationally. In particular, we examine whether the HOD depends on distance to key features of the cosmic web by explicitly quantifying these spatial relationships. We also analyze whether HODs vary across different cosmic environments, defined by critical point classifications, and assess the influence of intrinsic galaxy properties such as central galaxy color. We create volume-limited galaxy samples from SDSS-DR18 and use a group catalog to determine halo masses and identify central and satellite membership. Additionally, we employ a DisPerSE catalog to locate critical points such as maxima, minima, and filaments in the cosmic web. We evaluate how the HOD varies with proximity to these features and across five distinct cosmic environments. We further examine trends related to the color of central galaxies and test the robustness of our results with alternative DisPerSE catalogs generated using different smoothing scales and persistence thresholds. Our analysis shows that large-scale environments only weakly influence the HOD. However, second-order dependencies may be revealed through a multivariate approach that combines local and large-scale metrics with intrinsic galaxy properties. Future work with next-generation surveys and advanced modeling may achieve the precision required to detect and characterize these subtle environmental correlations.

 - **Abstract**
 Clustering algorithms can help reconstruct the assembly history of the Milky Way by identifying groups of stars sharing similar properties in a kinematical or chemical abundance space. However, although being promising tools, their efficiency has not yet been fully tested in a realistic cosmological framework. We investigate the effectiveness of the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm in the recovery of the progenitors of Milky Way-type galaxies, using several systems from the Auriga suite of simulations. We develop a methodology aimed at improving the efficiency of the algorithm and avoiding fragmentation: First, we use a 12-dimensional feature space including a range of chemodynamical properties and stellar ages; furthermore, we optimise the algorithm using information from the internal structure of the clusters of accreted stars. We show that our approach yields good results in terms of both purity and completeness of clusters for galaxies with different types of accretion histories. We also evaluate the decrease in efficiency due to contamination by in situ stars. While for accreted-only haloes the algorithm matches well the recovered clusters with the individual progenitors and is able to recover accretion events up to a redshift of accretion $z_{\rm acc}\sim3$, for accreted + in situ haloes it can only identify the more recent accretion events ($z_{\rm acc} < 1$). However, the purity of the identified clusters remains remarkably high even in this case. Our results suggest that HDBSCAN can efficiently identify accreted debris in Milky Way-type galaxies in realistic conditions, however, it requires careful optimization to provide valid results.
#### The Hubble constant from the improved lens modeling of cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal with new spectroscopic redshifts and the Jackknife method

 - **Abstract**
 Time-delay cosmology offers an alternative approach to measuring the Hubble constant ($H_0$), which is distinct from the cosmic distance ladder and cosmic microwave background radiation methods. In this study, we present an improved strong lens mass modeling analysis of the cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal, incorporating the latest spectroscopic redshift data from the MUSE on the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope CANUCS/Technicolor. The robustness of our lens models is confirmed using the Jackknife method. From our analysis that considers four lens mass models with different assumptions on profiles of dark matter halos and external perturbations, we derive a constraint on the Hubble constant of $H_0=66.0\pm{4.3}\Mpc$ after combining best-fitted values of the four lens models.

 - **Abstract**
 While cosmic reionization has been broadly constrained by global observables, the interplay between internal sources (Milky Way, M31, and their satellites) and external ionization fronts remains poorly understood in a realistic Local Group (LG) context. To address this issue, we perform radiative transfer post-processing on the original HESTIA LG constrained simulation. We calibrate our source models using a uniform 1024^3 particle, dark-matter only, HESTIA simulation coupled with a subgrid collapse-fraction model to match the global reionization observables. These source models are then applied to the HESTIA zoom-in simulations, which consist of a 4096^3 particle effective resolution in the zoom region centered on the Milky Way (MW) and M31 haloes, which resolves haloes down to 10^8 solar masses. We find that in all scenarios, reionization within the LG proceeds in an inside-out manner with the progenitors of the MW and M31 having 50 percent of their material ionized by z ~ 9-8.6, significantly earlier than the global midpoint at z ~ 7-7.7, noting that external fronts from large-scale structure play a negligible role, even under the most permissive feedback model. We further show that present-day satellite galaxies exhibit only a weak correlation between their reionization redshift and their present-day radial distance from their host halo, with somewhat tighter trends around M31 than the MW. Finally, we find that satellites which assembled before reionization are systematically more massive today, suggesting that the oldest stellar populations preferentially reside in the most massive subhaloes.
#### Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA) IV. Chrono-dynamics of seven old star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the peculiar origin of NGC 1841

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we report conclusive evidence for an ancient star cluster that has been accreted by the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). By leveraging observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we investigate the chrono-dynamical structure of a sample of seven old star clusters within the LMC in a self-consistent way. The multi-epoch nature of the dataset allowed the determination of high-precision proper motions for the clusters. Employing an isochrone-fitting methodology, we additionally infer from the deep high-resolution HST data homogeneous and robust estimates for their distances, ages and metallicities. Supplementing these data with literature line-of-sight velocities, we investigate the full 3-dimensional dynamics of the clusters within the frame of the LMC. With respect to the other clusters in our sample, NGC 1841 depicts a peculiar case. Its position in the age-metallicity plane, that makes it about 1 Gyr younger than the other metal-poor LMC clusters, but also its dynamical properties with a radial orbit almost perpendicular to the LMC disc plane, clearly advocates for a different origin. We thus conclude that NGC 1841 has likely been accreted by the LMC from a smaller galaxy. The other clusters in our sample show disc-like kinematics, with the case of NGC 2210 being peculiar, based on its inclined orbit. Their coherent age-metallicity relation closely resembles that of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus globular clusters, thus suggesting a similar early evolution for the two dwarf galaxies. We do not find clear-cut chrono-kinematic evidence that NGC 2005 has been accreted by the LMC as suggested by a previous study based on its chemical abundance pattern. Regardless of its nature, its very old age illustrates that peculiar chemical evolutions already emerge at very early times.
#### Signatures of dynamical activity in the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters in the FLAMINGO simulations

 - **Abstract**
 In anticipation of upcoming cosmological surveys, we use the large volume Flamingo hydrodynamical simulations to look for signatures of dynamical activity, focusing on the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters out to redshift $z=1$. To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider the halo mass accretion rate, $\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies: stellar mass gap, $\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray centroid shift, $\left<w\right>$. In general, the median values of these indicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both mass and redshift. We find $\left<w\right>$ to be the most reliable proxy, while $c_\mathrm{x}$ and $\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback model details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter density and $\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively (positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to both halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas densities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\left<w\right>$, but the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when stronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas density profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to what is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas density scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property could be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a first large-scale kinematic map of $\sim$50,000 young OB stars ($T_{\rm eff} \geq 10,000$ K), based on BOSS spectroscopy from the Milky Way Mapper OB program in the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V). Using photogeometric distances, line-of-sight velocities and Gaia DR3 proper motions, we map 3D Galactocentric velocities across the Galactic plane to $\sim$5 kpc from the Sun, with a focus on radial motions ($v_R$). Our results reveal mean radial motion with amplitudes of $\pm 30$ km/s that are coherent on kiloparsec scales, alternating between inward and outward motions. These $\bar{v}_R$ amplitudes are considerably higher than those observed for older, red giant populations. These kinematic patterns show only a weak correlation with spiral arm over-densities. Age estimates, derived from MIST isochrones, indicate that 85% of the sample is younger than $\sim300$ Myr and that the youngest stars ($\le 30$ Myr) align well with density enhancements. The age-dependent $\bar{v}_R$ in Auriga makes it plausible that younger stars exhibits different velocity variations than older giants. The origin of the radial velocity features remains uncertain, and may result from a combination of factors, including spiral arm dynamics, the Galactic bar, resonant interactions, or phase mixing following a perturbation. The present analysis is based on approximately one-third of the full target sample. The completed survey will enable a more comprehensive investigation of these features and a detailed dynamical interpretation.
