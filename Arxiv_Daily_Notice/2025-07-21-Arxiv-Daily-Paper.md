#### Studying the gaseous outskirts of galaxy groups with coherent Ly alpha absorption patterns

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explore the properties of diffuse intergalactic gas residing in the outskirts of the four nearby, low-mass galaxy groups NGC1052, NGC5866, NGC4631, and NGC3992 (all at cz<2000 km/s) beyond their group virial radii. Using archival ultraviolet absorption spectra of bright AGN observed with HST/COS, we search for HI Ly a absorption near the groups' recession velocities along 35 sightlines that pass the outer group medium (OGrM) at normalized impact parameters rho/Rvir=1-3. We derive HI column densities of the absorbers and constrain the physical conditions in the gas by using a hydrostatic toy model of the groups' gas environment and assuming photoionization. HI Ly absorption near the groups' recession velocities is detected along 19 sightlines with HI column densities in the range log N(HI)=12.50-14.34, implying a high OGrM detection rate of more than 50 percent. We transform this value into an incidence rate of OGrM absorbers per unit redshift of dN/dz=this http URL is 25 percent above the value derived for the general population of Ly a absorbers within z = 0 filaments and more than twice the value for the z = 0 Ly a forest. From the modeling, we obtain lower limits for the gas densities from log n_H=-5.00 to -3.72, comparable to densities found in the overall Ly a forest. Our study unveils a large cross section and overdensity of Ly a absorbers in the outskirts of these four nearby groups. Such an overdensity is in line with a previously proposed scenario, in which AGN feedback lifts gaseous material to large distances beyond the virial radius of groups into the OGrM. However, a larger survey of OGrM absorbers and a comparison with hydrodynamical simulations will be necessary to constrain the cosmological mass density of OGrM absorbers and pinpoint their role in cosmological structure formation and galaxy/group evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations have become an indispensable tool in astrophysics. To interpret their results, it is critical to understand their intrinsic variability, that is, how much the results change with numerical noise or inherent stochasticity of the physics model. We present a set of seven realisations of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy with the Auriga galaxy formation model. All realisations share the same initial conditions and code parameters, but draw different random numbers for the inherently stochastic parts of the model. We show that global galaxy properties at $z=0$, including stellar mass, star formation history, masses of stellar bulge and stellar disc, the radius and height of the stellar disk change by less than $10\%$ between the different realisations, and that magnetic field structures in the disc and the halo are very similar. In contrast, the star formation rate today can vary by a factor of two and the internal morphological structure of the stellar disc can change. The time and orbit of satellite galaxies and their galaxy properties when falling into the main halo are again very similar, but their orbits start to deviate after first pericenter passage. Finally, we show that changing the mass resolution of all matter components in the Auriga model changes galaxy properties significantly more than the intrinsic variability of the model, and that these changes are systematic. This limits detailed comparisons between simulations at different numerical resolutions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles are two pairs of large diffuse multi-band structures detected in our Milky Way galaxy, yet their origins remain uncertain. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the model where these bubbles were produced by two successive active galactic nucleus jet activities from the Galactic center, with their edges delineated by the correspondingly driven forward shocks. Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed morphology, multi-band X-ray surface brightness distributions between 0.11 and 2.04 keV, and O viii/O vii line ratios, matching ROSAT and eROSITA observations. The results indicate that the first jet pair, launched 15 Myr ago, created the eROSITA bubbles, now extending to ~15 kpc with gas temperatures of ~0.25 keV. The second jet pair, launched 5 Myr ago, produced the Fermi bubbles, currently reaching ~10 kpc with temperatures of 0.3--0.4 keV. The sharp edges of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles are naturally explained by the forward shocks in this double-episode jet scenario. Our findings support a Galactic-scale origin for these structures and suggest episodic jet activities from the Galactic center.

 - **Abstract**
 Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.
#### The dynamical evolution of the stellar clumps in the Sparkler galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations detected stellar clumps around the z=1.4 gravitationally lensed Sparkler galaxy (of stellar mass $M_*\sim 10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$), with ages and metallicities compatible with globular clusters (GCs). However, most of their masses ($>10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) and sizes (>30 pc) are about 10 times those of GCs in the local Universe. To assess whether these clumps can evolve into GCs, we performed N-body simulations of their dynamical evolution from z=1.4 to z=0 (9.23 Gyr), under the effect of dynamical friction and tidal stripping. Dynamical friction is studied performing multiple runs of a clump system in a Sparkler-like spherical halo of mass $M_{200}\simeq 5\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (from the stellar-to-halo mass relation). For the tidal stripping, we simulated resolved clumps, orbiting in an external, static gravitational potential including the same halo as in the dynamical friction simulations and also a Sparkler-like stellar disk. Dynamical friction causes the clumps with mass $>10^7\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to sink into the galaxy central regions, possibly contributing to the bulge growth. In absence of tidal stripping, the mass distribution of the surviving clumps (40%) peaks at $5\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, implying the presence of uncommonly over-massive clumps at z=0. Tidal shocks by the stellar disk strip considerable mass from low-mass clumps, even though their sizes remain larger than those of present-day GCs. When the surviving clumps are corrected for tidal stripping, their mass distribution peak shifts to $2\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, compatible with massive GCs. Our simulations suggest that a fraction of the Sparkler clumps is expected to fall into the central regions, where they might become bulge fossil fragments or contribute to form a nuclear star cluster. The remaining clumps are too large in size to be progenitors of GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new constraints on the halo masses and matter density profiles of DESI galaxy groups by cross-correlating samples of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) galaxies with the publicly available CMB lensing convergence map from ACT DR6. This provides an independent, lensing-based calibration of halo masses, complementary to methods relying on clustering or dynamics. We derive constraints on the mean halo mass for three DESI-selected samples, finding $\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h)) \approx 13.18$, 13.03 and 13.02 for the Main LRG, Extended LRG, and BGS samples, respectively. Using a halo model approach, we also compare the projected galaxy-matter density profiles with previously reported gas profiles inferred from measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. This work addresses one of the key uncertainties in interpreting kSZ signals -- the unknown host halo mass distribution -- by providing an independent and consistent mass calibration. The agreement between the gas and total mass profiles at large aperture suggests that sufficiently far from the group center (2--3 virial radii), we recover all the baryons, offering a resolution to the 'missing baryon' problem. We further study the cumulative gas fractions for all galaxies as well as for the most massive galaxy groups in the sample ($\log(M_{\rm halo}/(M_\odot/h)) \approx 13.5$), finding values that are physically sensible and in agreement with previous findings using kSZ and X-ray data: compared to the TNG300 simulation, the observed gas fractions are systematically lower at fixed radius by $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$, providing compelling, independent evidence for stronger baryonic feedback in the real Universe. These findings highlight the power of combining CMB lensing with galaxy surveys to probe the interplay between baryons and dark matter in group-sized halos.
