 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a population of compact galaxies in the early Universe with broad emission lines and strong Balmer breaks; among them the so-called ''little red dots'' (LRDs). Their nature remains uncertain with hypotheses including exotic phenomena. We assemble a sample of LRD-like objects at $z>3$ and use self-consistent radiative-transfer calculations to show that a supermassive black hole accreting from a dense gas cocoon accurately reproduces the detailed spectra. We show that the cocoons must be non-spherical, with comparable amounts of inflowing and outflowing material. And we predict correlations between Balmer break strength, Balmer line-absorption and scattering line width, which we confirm in our observed sample. We reproduce all LRD-like properties without requiring star-like atmospheres and we determine the typical black hole in our sample to be of order a million solar masses, with ionized cocoon masses of tens of solar masses potentially supplied from a much larger cold-gas reservoir.
#### Testing the inference of kinematics from mock JWST NIRSpec/MSA observations of TNG50 galaxies at $z\sim2-6$

 - **Abstract**
 We use the TNG50 galaxy formation simulation to generate mock JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec microshutter array (MSA) observations of H$\alpha$-emitting gas in $M_*=10^8-10^{11.5}\,M_\odot$ star-forming galaxies at $z=2-6$. We measure morphological properties from the mock imaging through Sersic profile fitting, and gas rotational velocities ($v$) and velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) by fitting the mock spectra as thin, rotating discs. To test the efficacy of such simple parametric models in describing complex ionised gas kinematics, we compare the best-fit quantities to intrinsic simulation measurements. At $z=3$, we find that $v$ and $\sigma$ for aligned and resolved sources generally agree well with intrinsic measurements, within a factor of $\sim$2 and $\sim$1.5, respectively. The recovery of kinematics is robust for smooth, disc-like systems, but $v$ and $\sigma$ can be over- or underestimated by more than a factor of 2, respectively, for intrinsically elongated systems. The scatter in the recovery accuracy is larger at higher redshift, as TNG50 galaxies at $z>3$ deviate more strongly from the thin rotating disc assumption. Despite uncertain measurements for individual galaxies, we find that key population trends, such as the weak redshift evolution of $\sigma$ and $v/\sigma$ as well as the dependence of $\sigma$ on the global star formation rate, are broadly recovered by our kinematic modelling. Our work provides the end-to-end framework needed to compare NIRSpec MSA observations to cosmological simulations and to quantify observational biases in measuring ionised gas kinematics, highlighting the need for the development of dedicated models for high-redshift galaxies.
#### Progenitor of the recoiling super-massive black hole RBH-1 identified using HST/JWST imaging

 - **Abstract**
 Using a combination of \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} imaging, a runaway supermassive black hole (RBH-1) was recently identified with an inferred velocity of $954^{+110}_{-126}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, likely ejected from a compact star-forming galaxy (denoted as GX) at $z \approx 0.96$. Assuming the runaway black hole was the outcome of the gravitational-wave-driven merger of two black holes, we use its measured runaway velocity together with gravitational-wave recoil predictions from numerical relativity and black hole perturbation theory to constrain the mass ratio and spin configuration of the progenitor SMBHs that overcame the final-parsec problem and merged $\sim 70$~Myr ago. We find that the progenitor binary must have been precessing, with a mass ratio $m_1/m_2\lesssim 6$, and that the more massive SMBH must have possessed a high spin (dimensionless spin magnitude $\sim 0.75$) in order to generate a recoil of this magnitude. This has important astrophysical implications as similar SMBH mergers can be an interesting source population for the upcoming LISA mission with signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim$ 1000. Furthermore, the progenitor SMBH properties imply that GX was likely formed through a major, gas-rich (``wet'') merger between two galaxies of comparable mass, with a mass ratio $\lesssim 4$.
