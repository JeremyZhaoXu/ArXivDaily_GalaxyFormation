 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially resolved analysis of stellar populations in the brightest $z>6$ galaxy known to date (AB mag 23), the strongly lensed MACS0308$-$zD1 (dubbed the ``Cosmic Spear'') at $z_{\rm spec}=6.2$. New JWST NIRCam imaging and high-resolution NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy span the rest-frame ultraviolet to optical. The NIRCam imaging reveals bright star-forming clumps and a tail consisting of three distinct, extremely compact star clusters that are multiply-imaged by gravitational lensing. The star clusters have effective radii of $R_{\rm{eff}} \sim 5$ pc, stellar masses of $M_{*} \sim 10^{6}-10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$, and high stellar mass surface densities of $\Sigma_{*} > 10^{4}\,M_{\odot}~\rm{pc}^{-2}$. While their stellar populations are very young ($\sim 5-9$ Myr), their dynamical ages exceed unity, consistent with the clusters being gravitationally bound systems. Placing the star clusters in the size vs.~stellar mass density plane, we find they occupy a region similar to other high-redshift star clusters within galaxies observed recently with JWST, being significantly more massive and denser than local star clusters. Spatially resolved analysis of the brightest clump reveals a compact, intensely star-forming core. The ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{\rm{ion}}$) is slightly suppressed in this central region, potentially indicating a locally elevated Lyman continuum escape fraction facilitated by feedback-driven channels.

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the formation history of the Milky Way bulge using a two-infall Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) framework implemented in the OMEGA++ code. We recover a best-fit scenario in which the bulge forms through an early, rapid starburst (t1 ~ 0.1Gyr, tau1 ~ 0.09Gyr, star-formation efficiency (SFE) ~ 3Gyr^-1 followed by a delayed, lower mass second infall (t2 ~ 5.1Gyr, tau2 ~ 1.7Gyr, sigma2 ~ 0.69). Our model adopts mass- and metallicity-dependent nucleosynthetic yields from modern stellar grids and explores a wide GCE parameter space in infall timing, star formation efficiency, mass partitioning, IMF upper mass, and SN Ia normalization, optimized via a hybrid genetic algorithm with MCMC refinement. The later infall features a reduced star formation efficiency (Delta SFE ~ 0.72), reproducing the metal-rich peak of the bulge metallicity distribution function (MDF) and the decline in [alpha/Fe] at high [Fe/H]. Our model naturally favors the Joyce et al. (2023) age--metallicity relation over the ages in Bensby et al. (2017). Degeneracy and principal component analysis show that the infall history, SFE, and mass partitioning are strongly covariant -- the bulge's observed MDF, abundance trends, and age distribution constrain only their combinations, not each parameter independently. The results support a composite bulge origin -- a classical collapse builds the majority of the mass, while a younger component is required to match the late stage enrichment.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way nuclear star cluster (MWNSC) is located together with its surrounding nuclear stellar disc (MWNSD) in the Galactic centre and they dominate the gravitational potential within the inner 300\,pc. However, the formation and evolution of both systems and their possible connections are still under debate. We reanalyse the low-resolution KMOS spectra in the MWNSC with the aim to improve the stellar parameters ($\rm T_{eff}$, $\rm \log\,g$, and $\rm [M/H])$ for the MWNSC. We use an improved line-list, especially dedicated for cool M giants allowing to improve the stellar parameters and to obtain in addition global $\rm \alpha$-elements. A comparison with high-resolution IR spectra (IGRINS) gives very satisfactory results pinning down the uncertainties to $\rm T_{eff} \simeq 150\,K$, $\rm log\,g \simeq 0.4\,dex$, and $\rm [M/H] \simeq 0.2\,dex$. Our $\rm \alpha$-elements agree within 0.1\,dex compared to the IGRINS spectra. We obtain a high-quality sample of 1140 M giant stars where we see an important contribution of a metal-poor population ($\rm \sim 20\,\%$) centered at $\rm [M/H] \simeq -0.7\,dex$ while the most dominant part comes from the metal-rich population with $\rm [M/H] \simeq 0.26\,dex$. We construct a metallicity map and find a metallicity gradient of $\rm \sim -0.1 \pm 0.02 \,dex/pc$ favouring the inside-out formation scenario for the MWNSC.

 - **Abstract**
 This dissertation explores the dynamics of relativistic spaceflight, focusing on the risks associated with collisions and photon interactions as a spacecraft approaches velocities near the speed of light. The study emphasizes two primary collision types: (1) collisions with interstellar dust and particles, and (2) interactions with cosmic molecules, specifically hydrogen. Using principles of energy conservation and relativistic mechanics, the energy transfer from these collisions is calculated, showing that even small particles can impart massive energy at relativistic speeds. The dissertation also examines the impact of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, particularly its blue-shifting effect at high velocities, which influences photon interactions with the spacecraft. Additionally, the Schwinger limit, which sets an upper bound on the electromagnetic field strength for sustained relativistic travel, is discussed in the context of photon-induced pair production. Lastly, advanced photon interactions, such as Compton scattering, are analyzed for their role in thermal management and spacecraft design. The findings highlight the importance of shielding, thermal regulation, and collision avoidance strategies in the design of spacecraft for interstellar travel, offering insights into the potential challenges and solutions for achieving relativistic spaceflight.

 - **Abstract**
 An accurate characterisation of the physical properties of galaxies at cosmic dawn is key to understanding the origin of the high abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z$\gtrsim$10. We exploit deep NIRSpec PRISM observations of GHZ2 to constrain the sources of ionising radiation and the properties of the ISM in this bright, compact, and highly ionising galaxy at z=12.3. We measure with high significance the prominent N IV, C IV, He II, O III, C III, O II, and Ne III emission features previously detected in shallower observations, and confirm the detection of the N III] $\lambda 1750$ multiplet, yielding tight constraints on the N/O ratio, which is found to be $\simeq$2 times the solar value. We also detect the Mg II $\lambda 2800$, [Fe IV] $\lambda 2833$ and Si II $\lambda 1812$ doublets, the H8+HeI $\lambda\lambda 3889$ blend, and the Si IV+O IV] $\lambda\lambda 1400$ absorption complex. The O III $\lambda 3133$ fluorescence line is only detected in the first observing epoch, implying variability on a rest-frame time span of 19 days, strongly suggesting the presence of an active nucleus. Combining the NIRSpec dataset with available optical and far-infrared constraints from MIRI and ALMA, we show that the emission spectrum of GHZ2 cannot be reproduced by single-density spectro-photometric models. Multi-zone photoionisation modelling performed with the HOMERUN code demonstrates that star formation must be occurring in a strongly stratified ISM, where both low-/intermediate-density gas and high-density regions (log($n_e$/cm$^{-3}) \gtrsim 4$) coexist. The GHZ2 emission landscape is consistent with either a composite star-formation plus AGN scenario, or with star formation occurring in a combination of radiation- and matter-bounded regions. Purely radiation-bounded stellar models fail to reproduce the observed He II emission, making an additional hard ionising component unavoidable.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Recently, JWST/NIRSpec observations have provided the first detections of warm ionised outflows in low-mass galaxies at high redshifts (z>3), revealing an occurrence rate of 25-40% depending on the intensity of the emission lines. This fraction is lower than predicted by simulations, which suggest that fast outflowing gas should be a common feature of all star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. Aims: In order to better understand the discrepancies between simulations and observations, we identify and characterize outflows in high-redshift galaxies using the TNG50 cosmological and SERRA zoom-in simulations. Our study examines how outflow detectability depends on the line of sight, explores the properties of the fast gas, and investigates its relationship with key galactic properties. Methods: We analyse approximately 60000 galaxies from TNG50 and 3000 galaxies from SERRA over the redshift ranges z=3-5 and z=4-5, respectively, spanning stellar masses of Mstar=10^7.5-10^11Msun. Outflows in the immediate vicinity of each galaxy are identified using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm that uses the gas velocity, star-formation-rate, and location as input parameters. We subsequently compare the simulated outflows to those observed in the JWST/JADES NIRSpec survey. Results: Outflow masses in both TNG50 and SERRA broadly reproduce the JWST/JADES measurements within roughly 0.5dex, though simulations tend to predict slightly higher values, suggesting that optical emission lines capture only a fraction of the multiphase outflow. However, simulated outflow velocities are typically an order of magnitude lower than those inferred from observations. TNG50 indicates a clear orientation dependence as outflows in face-on galaxies are approximately 15% more likely to be detected than in edge-on systems, with this difference increasing to nearly 40% for more massive, disc-shaped galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of low HI mass dwarf galaxies ($M_{\rm HI} < 10^8 M_\odot$) detected by The FAST All Sky HI Survey (FASHI) project. Due to the faint and irregular morphology of these galaxies, the default photometry is often inaccurate. Therefore, we utilized The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) data to perform careful photometric measurements, and find that the low HI mass galaxies have similar stellar mass densities to dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies. Compared to other dwarf galaxy populations, the HI-selected dwarfs exhibit higher stellar mass densities than ultradiffuse galaxies, and similar densities to HI-selected low-surface-brightness galaxies, albeit with lower stellar masses, suggesting a possible evolutionary connection among these populations. By classifying the galaxies according to their HI spectral-line profiles, we show that the double-peaked sources conform closely to the Tully-Fisher relation, whereas the single-peaked sources follow the Faber-Jackson relation but with large scatter. This indicates that the single-peaked systems are likely dispersion dominated and that the relationship between stellar mass and halo mass in such systems may remain consistent across both low- and high-mass regimes. These findings suggest that HI-selected dwarf galaxies with single-peaked HI profiles may share a similar dynamical state with massive ellipticals, offering new insights into their structural evolution and the diversity of formation pathways for low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Using public data from five pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), we search for a stationary, isotropic, and unpolarized nHz stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We use pulse time-of-arrival data from 121 pulsars, which is more informative than previous searches, carried out separately by the individual PTA collaborations using only their own data. For pulsars observed by more than one PTA, we employ a new "direct combination" method to merge their astrophysical models and data. This avoids the challenge of reconciling the different PTA timing models to obtain a single "best" model. A central result of our analysis is posterior probability distributions for the amplitude $A_{gw}$ and exponent $\gamma_{gw}$ of the putative SGWB energy-density spectrum, modeled as a power law in frequency. While these results are consistent with a nonzero SGWB amplitude $A_{gw}$, the statistical significance--assessed via a Bayesian odds ratio and through noise-marginalized false-alarm probabilities ($p$-values) for three different detection statistics--remains below the conventional $5\sigma$ threshold for a confident detection. We also reconstruct the inter-pulsar timing-residual correlation as a function of the angle $\theta$ between the pulsar lines of sight. This is consistent with the curve predicted by Hellings and Downs (HD).

 - **Abstract**
 Effects of General Relativity are usually neglected in the non-linear evolution of structures, where Newtonian $N$-body simulations are traditionally employed. In the post-Friedmann expansion framework, a weak-field relativistic approximation purpose-built for cosmology, a frame-dragging gravito-magnetic vector potential arises at leading order, sourced by momentum currents, contributing to the metric even if the dynamics of matter fields at this order is Newtonian, and can thus be extracted from $N$-body simulations. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator code on the IllustrisTNG simulations, here we extend previous work in order to compute the power spectrum of this vector potential down to galactic scales. The magnitude of the vector potential is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by perturbation theory, and is a $1\% \sim 0.1\%$ effect compared to the non-linear Newtonian scalar gravitational potential. In the red-shift range considered here, the gravito-magnetic effect remains subdominant, without showing any enhancement during a particular phase in the evolution of structures, aside from the continuous growth of non-linearity at low redshift. Although this seems to suggest that, within the $\Lambda$CDM model, no significant gravito-magnetic effects contribute to the non-linear evolution of cosmic structures, i.e. to the dynamics of massive particles, possible observational consequences, e.g. in lensing, deserve further exploration.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of dwarf galaxies provide essential insight into galaxy formation and evolution in a hierarchical universe. Among various physical quantities, identifying their infall times to host galaxies is crucial, as these times encode key information such as star formation histories. However, estimating infall times remains challenging due to the complex interplay between different physical processes and the lack of consensus among existing methods. We propose a fast and interpretable method to predict the infall time of dwarf satellites using LightGBM, a gradient-boosting decision tree algorithm. Our model is trained on satellites from 30 Milky Way (MW)-like host galaxies generated by A-SLOTH, a semi-analytic model calibrated using observational constraints, including those from the MW and its satellites. To balance predictive ability and observational applicability, we adopt $\tau_{90}$, [Fe/H], and $M_{\star}$ as input features. Since satellites with prior group membership hinder accurate MW infall predictions, we exclude them from the training data. As a result, the model achieves the best average mean squared error (MSE) of 5.04 in the A-SLOTH data set. Our model also shows good agreement with existing observational studies of MW satellites, although some discrepancies remain due to a few outliers such as CVn II and UMa I. In addition, for satellites experiencing prior infall events before MW-like host infall, the model predicts the timing of the first infall with a significantly lower MSE of 1.66, indicating the importance of the earliest infall in the quenching process of satellite galaxies.
#### Self-lensing of moving gravitational-wave sources can break the microlensing crossing timescale degeneracy

 - **Abstract**
 When a moving gravitational-wave (GW) source travels behind a massive astrophysical object, its signal is gravitationally lensed, showing a waveform distortion similar to a Paczyński curve. We present a first study of the lensing signature of a massive black hole (MBH) on a frequency-dependent GW signal from a moving binary merger. For both light and GW sources in a Keplerian circular orbit around a MBH lens, the self-lensing geometry breaks the microlensing degeneracy in the Einstein radius crossing timescale $t_{\rm E}$. The duration of the curve ($2 t_{\rm E}$) becomes independent on the MBH mass $M_{\rm MBH}$, and provides a direct measure of the distance $d_{\rm LS}$ to the MBH. However, $M_{\rm MBH}$ remains unknown. We show that, in GW signals, the redshifted mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ can additionally be obtained from the interference pattern, by measuring the modulation period $T$, the GW frequency $f$, and $t_{\rm E}$: $M_{{\rm MBH},z}\simeq 2.5\times 10^6\,M_\odot\,(t_{\rm E}/[100\,{\rm s}])\,(f\,T)^{-1}$. If this lensing signature is not considered, it may be confused with other waveform distortions, especially in the modeling of overlapping signals in next generation ground-based GW detectors. The observation of one of these curves and its associated parameters may help (1) constrain the orbital distance $d_{\rm LS}$ of sources, especially around low mass MBHs at the centers of star clusters and galaxies, (2) additionally estimate the mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ of these MBHs, and (3) infer the orbital inclination of the binary. Simultaneously obtaining $d_{\rm LS}$ and $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ through self-lensing can help constrain the astrophysical environments where GW signals come from.
#### Resolving the (Debate About) Nozzle Shocks in Tidal Disruption Events

 - **Abstract**
 When a star passes within the Roche limit of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), it is pulled apart by the BH's tidal field in a tidal disruption event (TDE). The resulting flare is powered by the circularization and accretion of bound stellar debris, which initially returns to the BH on eccentric orbits in a thin debris stream. The returning fluid elements follow inclined orbits that converge near pericenter, resulting in extreme vertical compression to scales $10^{-4}~R_\odot$ and the formation of a nozzle shock. Dissipation at the nozzle shock may affect circularization by altering the properties of the debris stream, but its role is the subject of ongoing debate. We develop an idealized model for the debris stream evolution combining 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations, the semi-analytic affine model, and 1D finite-volume hydrodynamic simulations. Because our model is computationally cheap, we can unambiguously resolve the nozzle shock, use a realistic equation of state, and follow the debris stream evolution at many different times. Near peak fallback, Hydrogen recombination and molecular Hydrogen formation broaden the stream by a factor $\sim 5$, enhancing dissipation at the nozzle. However, the dissipation is still insufficient to directly circularize the debris by in-plane pressure gradients. Instead, the thicker stream substantially increases the likelihood that the stream self-intersects on the second orbit, despite relativistic nodal precession. The stream properties at self-intersection are sensitive to dissipation at the nozzle and the timing of focal points where the ballistic trajectories of the debris converge. Our results clarify the nozzle shock's role in circularization in TDEs, providing a foundation for more realistic circularization and emission models.
