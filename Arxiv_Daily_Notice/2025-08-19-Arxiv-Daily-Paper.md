#### Serendipitous discovery of a young cluster of galaxies at $z \sim 0.5$ projected next to the nearby tadpole galaxy KUG 1138 + 327

 - **Abstract**
 Using a 90 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation in the 0.3--7 keV band, along with complementary Low-Frequency Array and Karl G.~Jansky Very Large Array data in the 120--168 MHz and 1--2 GHz ranges, we study the diffuse emission around the nearby dwarf galaxy KUG~1138+327. Our analysis reveals a diffuse X-ray feature on the southern side, disconnected from the galactic disk. This feature exhibits a hard X-ray spectrum, which is highly unusual for an outflow from a dwarf galaxy. We interpret the irregularly shaped feature as hot plasma in a young galaxy cluster at redshift 0.5, supported by X-ray spectral fitting and consistent with the optical redshift of the central elliptical galaxy of a known cluster identified by a red sequence. Additionally, we detect a radio lobe east of the X-ray feature, likely produced by an AGN offset from the cluster center and confined primarily by ram pressure from the ambient medium. The lobe shows a steep nonthermal radio spectrum, suggesting a cosmic-ray age of $\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{7}$~yr. Assuming energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic fields, we estimate the lobe's total energy to be $\sim 9 \times 10^{56}~\mathrm{erg}$, comparable to the thermal energy in the same volume. This study thus identifies a background young cluster projected next to KUG~1138+327 and highlights the potentially significant role of off-center AGN feedback in shaping the intracluster medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshift ($z \ge 10$) from a combination of dark matter capture, black-hole mergers, and gas accretion. It has previously been shown that SMBHs can form by $z \approx 10$ via black-hole mergers, Eddington-limited Bondi gas accretion and tidal disruption events with stars within dense nuclear clusters. Here, we show that the capture of collisionless dark matter by a growing SMBH also substantially contributes, in some cases by an order of magnitude to the final SMBH mass. In particular, we show that a small seed stellar-remnant black hole can more easily reach $> 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ by $z = 10$ in the core of dense nuclear star clusters when dark matter is included. This remains true for either cold dark matter or ultralight dark matter if the mass of the ULDM particle is $^>_\sim 10^{-20}$ eV. We highlight the unique evolution of ULDM capture by the growing SMBH when the ULDM de Broglie wavelength exceeds the initial nuclear star cluster half-mass radius.

 - **Abstract**
 Comparing the dynamical and stellar masses of Milky Way (MW) globular clusters (GCs) reveals a discrepancy exceeding a factor of two. Since this substantial invisible mass is concentrated in the cluster centre, it is attributed to stellar remnants. The majority of mass in remnants consists of white dwarfs (WDs). Allocating over half of a GC's current mass to WDs could significantly restrict the dynamical evolution scenarios governing stellar clusters. As the most massive stars in GCs, black holes (BHs) exert a substantial effect on the escape rate of lower mass stars, such as WDs. This paper aims to identify which scenarios of BH natal kicks can accurately reproduce the notable dark remnant fraction observed in MW GCs. We compare the observed remnant fraction of MW GCs with a comprehensive grid of direct \Nbody simulations while adjusting the natal kick received by BHs. Our results reveal that simulations employing low natal kicks to BHs are the only ones capable of mirroring the remnant fraction of MW GCs. According to the Spitzer instability, the presence of a BH population prompts the formation of a BH sub-system (BHSub) at the centre of a star cluster. The BHSub serves as an energetic power plant, continually releasing kinetic energy through few-body encounters between single and binary BHs, and transferring the generated energy to the entire stellar population. This energy induces a significant difference in the ejection rate of stellar remnants and luminous stars, ultimately increasing the fraction of dark remnants within the star cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a numerical discovery that the formations of cosmic voids are closely linked with the mechanism through which the giant galaxies on void surfaces establish elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR. Identifying the voids from the TNG300-1 simulations via the Void-Finder algorithm, we explore if and how the shapes of the TNG galaxies located on void surfaces are aligned with the directions toward the void centers. Noting that only the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\star}\ge 10^{10.5}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular alignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\star}$-controlled samples according to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or bluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found that the void-galaxy perpendicular alignment becomes stronger for the cases that the void-surface galaxies have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR. The numerical results are also shown to be well described by the analytical one-parameter model derived under the assumption of the existence of a linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local tidal tensors. Our result implies that the compression of adjacent matter due to the formation and rapid expansion of cosmic voids prevent them from radial infall/accretion, which in turn contribute to stalling and quenching the giant void-surface galaxies. Given that the formation epochs and expansion rates of cosmic voids depend sensitively on the dark energy equation of state, we also discuss a possibility of using the abundance of elliptical void-surface galaxies as a probe of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Following a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in a double white dwarf (WD) binary, a surviving WD companion leaves at its orbital velocity $\approx 1$,000 - 3,000 km/s. The Gaia mission has discovered seven such hypervelocity WDs with inflated radii indicative of shock heating by SN ejecta. We study the interaction between SN ejecta and Roche lobe-filling 0.08 - 0.45 $M_{\odot}$ helium WD companions using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with Athena++. Given the importance of the later thermal evolution, we include an accurate equation-of-state for the degenerate helium WD donor. We show that a lower-mass, larger-radius WD companion is more strongly impacted by SN ejecta and undergoes substantial mass loss. We find a tight relation between the fractional mass loss and the ratio between the ejecta ram pressure and donor volume-averaged pressure, which can be used for predicting mass loss in other systems. In the most extreme case, the companion becomes a very inflated $\approx0.02\,M_{\odot}$ object. We find helium mass loss $\approx 0.005 - 0.06\,M_{\odot}$ with velocities $\approx $ 1,000$-$4,000 km/s, which may lead to emission lines in the nebular phase. The surviving helium WD receives a kick velocity, but its final velocity is essentially determined by its orbital velocity $\lesssim$ 1,600 km/s. We model the post-explosion evolution of the shock-heated companions using MESA, and find reasonable agreement with the hypervelocity stars D6-2, J0546+0836, J1332-3541 & SDSS J1637+3631. A surviving $\gtrsim 0.3\,M_{\odot}$ helium WD can be ruled out in SN1972E & SN2011fe, and any surviving helium WD is likely ruled out in SN remnants 0509-67.5 & SN1006.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate estimation of dark matter halo masses for galaxy groups is central to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible systematic bias (mean $\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\sigma$ = 0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields the highest precision (mean $\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended for GAMA-like surveys (i < 19.2) at z < 0.1 where minimal model dependence is required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates across diverse catalogues with limits of z < 0.3. These calibrated estimators will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Two main models coexist for the environment in which stars form. The clustered model stipulates that the bulk of star formation occurs within dense embedded clusters, but only a minority of them survive the residual gas expulsion phase caused by massive stellar feedback unbinding the clusters. On the other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at a range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the densest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected for completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star formation rate within OCs ($\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent estimates of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have applied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law that was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The second one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest OCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local values of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values between $736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, depending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than previous $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the incompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\geq$ 50 \%) or even the vast majority ($\geq$ 80 \%) of the star formation occurring in initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ from the recent literature. Our new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with clustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Both star clusters and variable stars are sensitive laboratories of stellar astrophysics and evolution: cluster member stars provide context for interpreting cluster populations, whereas variability reveals the nature of individual stellar systems. The European Space Agency's Gaia mission has revolutionized the census of star clusters in the Milky Way, while simultaneously providing an unprecedented homogeneous all-sky catalog of variable stars. Here, we leverage the third Gaia data release to obtain an empirical bird's eye view of stellar evolution based on 34760 variable stars residing in 1192 Galactic open clusters (OCs) containing 173294 members (variable member fraction 20.0%). Using precise OC distances, dereddened magnitudes, and consistently determined ages, we a) pinpointed regions of pulsational instability across the color-absolute magnitude diagram (CaMD); b) traced the occurrence rate of variables as a function of age, and c) considered the evolution of rotation periods and photometric activity (gyrochronology). The occurrence of pulsating stars can serve as a model- and reddening-independent age estimator. Our results underline that jointly considering stellar variability and OC membership enables a plethora of further applications, such as age dating or dereddening OCs based on expected CaMD locations of variable stars. Upcoming Gaia data releases and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will vastly increase the extent to which the details of variable stars in OCs can empirically unravel the astrophysics and evolution of stellar populations.
#### EP250207b is not a collapsar fast X-ray transient. Is it due to a compact object merger?

 - **Abstract**
 Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are short-lived extra-galactic X-ray sources. Recent progress through multi-wavelength follow-up of Einstein Probe discovered FXTs has shown that several are related to collapsars, which can also produce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper we investigate the nature of the FXT EP250207b. The VLT/MUSE spectra of a nearby (15.9 kpc in projection) lenticular galaxy reveal no signs of recent star formation. If this galaxy is indeed the host, EP250207b lies at a redshift of z=0.082, implying a peak observed absolute magnitude for the optical counterpart of M_r=-14.5. At the time when supernovae (SNe) would peak, it is substantially fainter than all SN types. These results are inconsistent with a collapsar origin for EP250207b. The properties favour a binary compact object merger driven origin. The X-ray, optical and radio observations are compared with predictions of several types of extra-galactic transients, including afterglow and kilonova models. The data can be fit with a slightly off-axis viewing angle afterglow. However, the late-time (~30 day) optical/NIR counterpart is too bright for the afterglow and also for conventional kilonova models. This could be remedied if that late emission is due to a globular cluster or the core of a (tidally disrupted) dwarf galaxy. If confirmed, this would be the first case where the multi-wavelength properties of an FXT are found to be consistent with a compact object merger origin, increasing the parallels between FXTs and GRBs. We finally discuss if the source could originate in a higher redshift host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the cold atomic hydrogen gas (HI) within cosmic filaments has the potential to pin down the relationship between the low density gas in the cosmic web and how the galaxies that lie within it grow using this material. We report the discovery of a cosmic filament using 14 HI-selected galaxies that form a very thin elongated structure of 1.7 Mpc. These galaxies are embedded within a much larger cosmic web filament, traced by optical galaxies, that spans at least $\sim 15$~Mpc. We find that the spin axes of the HI galaxies are significantly more strongly aligned with the cosmic web filament ($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.64 \pm 0.05$) than cosmological simulations predict, with the optically-selected galaxies showing alignment to a lesser degree ($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.55 \pm 0.05$). This structure demonstrates that within the cosmic filament, the angular momentum of galaxies is closely connected to the large-scale filamentary structure. We also find strong evidence that the galaxies are orbiting around the spine of the filament, making this one of the largest rotating structures discovered thus far, and from which we can infer that there is transfer of angular momentum from the filament to the individual galaxies. The abundance of HI galaxies along the filament and the low dynamical temperature of the galaxies within the filament indicates that this filament is at an early evolutionary stage where the imprint of cosmic matter flow on galaxies has been preserved over cosmic time.
