 - **Abstract**
 Compact galaxy groups are ideal laboratories for studying the effects of interactions between AGN and multiple nearby galaxies. Recent JWST observations of the nearby compact group Stephan's Quintet highlight tidal flows between the interacting galaxies as well as outflows from the active galaxy NGC 7319. To study the kinematics on a large scale throughout the group, we obtained spatially-resolved long-slit spectra of Stephan's Quintet at multiple slit positions with Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph. We fit multiple Gaussians to the H$\alpha$ $\lambda$6563 Å and [N II] $\lambda\lambda$6548, 6583 Å emission lines to isolate the different kinematic components. We used the kinematics to develop the first biconical outflow model of the narrow-line region of NGC 7319. Using a combination of galactic rotation models, biconical outflow models, and kinematic maps of the ionized gas, we disentangled the outflows, rotation, and tidal flows in the group. We found outflow radial velocities up to 550 km s$^{-1}$ peaking at 2.6 kpc from the central supermassive black hole, and a transition from AGN-powered outflows to gravitationally-powered tidal flows at a projected distance between 2.4 -- 6.3 kpc. We performed a line ratio analysis and determined the gas shows Seyfert-like ionization out to 6.3 kpc (projected), which supports our finding that gas outside this radius is predominantly powered by tidal flows. Our separation of kinematic components in Stephan's Quintet will enable future studies of the physical conditions and dynamical forces in the ionized gas to better quantify the feeding and feedback processes of AGN in compact groups.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) imaging products of the fifth data release (DR5) of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The JADES survey is one of the most ambitious programs yet conducted on JWST, producing deep infrared imaging and multiobject spectroscopy on the GOODS-S and GOODS-N extragalactic deep fields in order to explore galaxies to the earliest epoch. Here we describe the NIRCam data reduction procedures that result in deep and well-characterized mosaics in up to 18 filters covering 469 arcmin$^2$, with 250 arcmin$^2$ having at least 8 filters of coverage. This release contains the full NIRCam imaging of JADES, over 800 JWST mission hours, as well as co-reductions of 19 other programs in these two premier deep fields. We perform detailed tests on the final data products, thereby characterizing the photometric properties, point-spread function, and astrometric alignment. We release mosaics for individual programs (or epochs, depending on scheduling) and the mosaics combining data from all programs in order to facilitate photometric variability studies and the deepest possible photometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Medium to ultra-deep mid-infrared imaging surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)'s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) are reframing our view of the early Universe, from the emergence of ultra-red dusty and quiescent galaxies to the epoch of reionization to the first galaxies. Here we present the MIRI coordinated parallels component of the JADES program, which obtained ultra-deep (155 ks) imaging at $7.7 \mu$m over $\sim10$ arcmin$^2$ as well as medium depth ($\sim5-15$ ks) imaging at $7.7, 12.8$, and $15 \mu$m over $\sim36$, 25, and 22 arcmin$^2$, respectively, in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. This paper describes the data reduction, which combines the official JWST Calibration Pipeline with custom steps to optimize flagging of warm/hot pixels and optimize background subtraction. We further introduce a new step to address artifacts caused by persistence from saturating sources. The final, fully reduced JADES/MIRI mosaics are being released as part of JADES Data Release 5, along with prior-based forced photometry using NIRCam detection images, providing critical rest-frame near-infrared and optical constraints on early galaxy populations.

 JADES Data Release 5 (DR5) photometric catalogs and describes the methodologies used for source detection, deblending, photometry, uncertainty estimation, and catalog curation. The catalogs are constructed from 35 space-based imaging mosaics obtained with JWST/NIRCam, JWST/MIRI, HST/ACS, and HST/WFC3, combining approximately 1250 hours of JADES imaging with extensive additional public JWST and HST observations in the GOODS fields. Sources are identified using custom signal-to-noise-based detection and deblending algorithms optimized for the depth, resolution, and complex point-spread-function structure of JWST imaging. Source centroids, shapes, and photometric apertures are determined using a new fast two-dimensional Gaussian regression method applied to detection-image profiles. We provide forced circular-aperture photometry, ellipsoidal Kron photometry, and curve-of-growth measurements for every source in every band. We introduce a new pixel-level regression framework to model photometric uncertainties as a function of aperture size and local mosaic properties, accounting for correlated noise in heterogeneous JWST mosaics. Photometric redshifts are computed using template-based fitting applied to both small-aperture photometry on unconvolved images and Kron photometry on common-PSF mosaics. The JADES DR5 catalogs supersede previous JADES photometric releases, and are publicly released through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes and an interactive web interface.

 - **Abstract**
 We present morphological parameters and their uncertainties for all sources detected in JWST/NIRCam imaging in GOODS-N and GOODS-S from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) catalogs. We model the surface brightness profiles of these sources with single-component Sérsic profiles, performing Bayesian inference of galaxy structural parameters. We fit each of the $>10^5$ sources with every available JWST/NIRCam wide-band filter individually, amounting to over 3 million Sérsic profiles computed. We provide catalogs of this morphological information, building one of the largest extragalactic morphological datasets to date, which we share alongside imaging and photometry from the JADES Data Release 5. With this information, we analyze the rest-frame optical redshift evolution of the effective radius and the surface luminosity density within a radius of 1 kiloparsec, $\Sigma_{\text{1 kpc}}$, for 24,692 galaxies at $z>1$. We find $r_{\text{eff}} \propto (1+z)^{-0.635 \pm 0.013}$ kpc, while $\Sigma_{\text{1 kpc}}$ is relatively constant across time. Additionally, we explore bulge-disk decomposition on a subset of 8,390 galaxies in the JADES deep imaging covering the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, finding the effective radius of the bulge-components to increase marginally with time, whereas the disk-component sizes evolve as $r_{\text{eff,disk}} \propto (1+z)^{-1.091 \pm 0.043}$. Future work modeling multi-component surface brightness profiles will enable further analysis of the morphological evolution of galaxies across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Wisps are among the most prominent scattered light artifacts in JWST/NIRCam imaging. They often appear in certain regions of the detectors and contaminate observations at surface-brightness levels relevant for faint-source photometry. We introduce a new subtraction method that uses the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to model and remove wisps. Using deep NIRCam observations from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and other programs, we construct multi-component, filter- and detector-specific wisp templates that capture the wisp structures and their exposure-to-exposure morphological variations. Wisps in individual exposures are represented as non-negative linear combinations of these templates, consistent with their additive nature and reducing degeneracies relative to single-template scaling. Compared to existing approaches, our method delivers lower residual root mean square in wisp-affected regions and reduces photometric bias and scatter to levels consistent with clean detector areas. The NMF wisp templates are readily applicable to other datasets and are publicly released to support future NIRCam extragalactic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of 2081 sources selected at photometric redshift $z_{\mathrm{phot}} > 8$ across the JADES DR5 data release in GOODS-S and GOODS-N over a total area of 469 square arcmin. These sources range from $M_{\mathrm{UV}} = -22$ to $M_{\mathrm{UV}} = -16$, with 19 objects at $z_{\mathrm{phot}} > 14$. We estimate the UV slopes for the full sample from fits to the photometry and find evidence for a steepening of the relationship between the UV continuum slope and $M_{\mathrm{UV}}$ to higher redshifts, a result that differs from prior analyses of brighter samples in the literature. We provide evidence that over one quarter of our sources have evidence for being morphologically extended, with many galaxies showing multiple bright knots or clumps even out to $z \sim 13 - 14$, an indication of how galaxies at Cosmic Dawn are growing and evolving. We discuss JADES-GN+189.15982+62.28899, a GOODS-N F200W dropout galaxy at $z_{\mathrm{phot}} \sim 15 - 18$ which has been observed spectroscopically with JWST/NIRSpec in prism mode, resulting in a very low signal-to-noise spectrum that is consistent with the photometry and rules out a number of low-redshift solutions for the source. Finally, we use a subsample of 123 objects in our sample with spectroscopic redshifts to explore the usage of alternate fitting templates and a prescription for Ly-$\alpha$ damping wing absorption, finding that both produce significant improvements to the estimated photometric redshifts.
#### JADES: A Prominent Galaxy Overdensity Candidate within the First 500 Myr

 - **Abstract**
 We report a galaxy overdensity candidate at $z\approx 10.5$ in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). This overdensity contains 18 galaxies with consistent photometric redshifts and robust F115W dropouts within 8 comoving Mpc in projection. The galaxy number density is four times higher than the field expectation, accounting for one-third of comparably bright galaxies and nearly 50% of the total star formation rate at $10<z_\mathrm{phot}<12$ in the GOODS-S field. Two compact members of the overdensity show potential Balmer breaks suggestive of evolved stellar populations or little red dots (LRDs). One-third of galaxies have close companions or substructures within 1 kpc at consistent photometric redshifts, implying more frequent interactions in an overdense environment. Most galaxies have stellar masses of 0.6-3$\times10^8$ $M_\odot$, half-light radii of $\sim$200 pc, and star formation rates of $\sim$5 $M_\odot \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, with no significant deviation from typical high-redshift scaling relations. We find tentative evidence for a spatially varying Ly$\alpha$ transmission inferred photometrically, consistent with an emerging ionized bubble. This overdensity provides a rare opportunity for probing the environmental impact on galaxy evolution and the onset of cosmic reionization within the first 500 Myr.
#### JADES: Discovery of Large Reservoirs of Small Dust Grains in the Circumgalactic Medium of Massive Galaxies at $z\sim3.5$ through Deep JWST/NIRCam Imaging and Grism Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Using JWST NIRCam imaging and grism spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) Origins Fields, we report spectroscopic redshift measurements of 1,445 emission-line galaxies at $z=0-9$. Within this sample, we identify two prominent galaxy protoclusters at $z = 3.47$ and 3.69, each anchored by massive dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). In the vicinity of these systems, we discover seven background galaxies at $z=3.6 - 6$ that simultaneously exhibit strong rest-frame optical emission lines (e.g., [O III] and H$\alpha$) and unusually reddened UV-to-optical continua. We attribute this reddening to dust extinction arising from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the foreground DSFGs at projected separations of 7-30 kpc. We infer a high dust column density ($\gtrsim 10^{-1}$ Msun/kpc^2), substantially exceeding those measured in low-redshift halos and those predicted by hydrodynamical simulations like IllustrisTNG and FIRE-2. The steep extinction curves, comparable to or steeper than that of the SMC, indicate a dominant population of small dust grains in the high-redshift CGM. We conclude that DSFGs at this epoch host large reservoirs of dusty CGM enriched to solar metallicity. These extended dust components are largely invisible to (sub-)millimeter interferometers such as ALMA because of their low surface brightness. We discuss the physical processes in dust transport that might be key to reproducing our observations, including galaxy mergers, cool-phase gas outflows, dust shattering, sputtering and radiation pressure. Finally, we caution that foreground CGM dust extinction may redden background galaxies at intermediate redshifts to mimic Lyman-break galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$.

 - **Abstract**
 In the local Universe, supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses strongly correlate with their host-galaxies' stellar masses ($M_{*}$), but galaxies hosting faint AGN recently found by JWST may deviate from this relation. To constrain the M$_{\text{BH}}$-M$_{*}$ relation at high redshift, we performed AGN-host image decomposition for 17 low-luminosity AGN galaxies at $z$\,$\sim$\,4--6 using NIRCam images in the JADES GOODS-N field. These sources are identified as AGNs from broad H$\alpha$ emission lines detected by the CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys. We used \textsc{galfit+MCMC} to fit spatial profiles in 7 wide-band images and detected extended emission in 9 sources out of 17. The close spatial alignment between the extended components and the AGN centers indicates that this emission likely originates from the host galaxies. These sources are extended at 0.9--2.0~$\mu$m, suggesting significant host-galaxy light in the rest-frame UV. For the sources with the host detection, the stellar mass inferred based on image decomposition result can be 1-2 dex lower than the results without image decomposition. The BH-to-stellar mass ratio spans $M_{\text{BH}}/M_\ast$\,$\sim$\,0.01--1.48, placing them well above the local $M_{\text{BH}}$--$M_\ast$ relation. In contrast, the host-galaxy size--mass relation broadly agrees with previous measurements. Our results suggest that the host galaxies of these faint AGN are either genuinely under-massive compared to their black hole masses, or too compact to be spatially resolved.
#### There Is More to Outshining: 2D Dust Effects on Stellar Mass Estimates at $3 \leq z < 9$ with JWST in the JADES Field

 - **Abstract**
 Dust attenuation modifies the observed spectral energy distribution (SED), leading to biases in the properties inferred from integrated SED fitting. As spatially resolved SED modeling becomes feasible for large high-redshift samples, it is increasingly important to assess how dust attenuation affects resolved mass estimates. We evaluate the impact of dust attenuation on stellar mass estimates derived from integrating spatially resolved SED fitting results. We perform spatially resolved and integrated SED fitting on a sample of 3408 galaxies at $3 \leq z < 9$ from the GOODS South field, combining deep NIRCam from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and HST/ACS imaging from GOODS and CANDELS. We compare galaxy-integrated properties derived from fitting the summed SED with those obtained from spatially resolved SED modeling. Using a two-component dust attenuation model with a variable slope, we investigate how the dust attenuation slope, A(V), and stellar population properties contribute to discrepancies in the resulting stellar mass estimates. Resolved stellar masses are systematically higher than integrated estimates, with a median offset of +0.24 dex. Resolved analyses recover higher dust attenuations ($\Delta A(V)\approx +0.08$ mag), lower birth cloud fractions ($\Delta\mu \approx -0.28$), and grayer attenuation curves ($\Delta\delta_{\mathrm{ISM}} = +0.08$), arising from preferential sampling of compact star-forming regions. Integrated fits underestimate stellar ages by $\sim23\%$ at $z < 5$ and 31$\%$ at $z \gtrsim 5$. The stellar mass offset correlates strongly with the age difference and the attenuation slope difference, indicating that age-dependent outshining and spatially varying dust geometry are primary drivers of the discrepancy between resolved and integrated stellar masses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present nitrogen abundance measurements based on the low-ionisation [NII]6583 emission line for 588 galaxies between 1.5<z<7.0 from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). We detect the temperature-sensitive [OIII]4363 auroral line in 40 galaxies in our sample, affording $T_e$-based abundances for this subset. We find that the average N/O abundance ratio in our low-metallicity sample is at least 0.1 dex higher than z ~ 0 samples. In particular, we find significant scatter toward high N/O, with five galaxies being identified with enhanced nitrogen abundances (log(N/O)>-1.1) at low-metallicity (12+log(O/H)<8.0) from $T_e$-based measurements. Meanwhile, applying strong-line abundance measurements to the remainder of our sample reveals a further 14 candidate galaxies passing these abundance cuts, implying that around 13 % of 12+log(O/H)<8.0 galaxies at these redshifts are nitrogen-enhanced at this level. We find that N/O abundance in low-metallicity systems correlates with SFR, surface density of SFR, and surface density of stellar mass at high redshift, while only in high-metallicity systems does a correlation with stellar mass emerge. Despite healthy representation of these `moderately nitrogen-enhanced' galaxies (-1.1<log(N/O)<-0.6), no galaxies in our low-metallicity sample are identified as having log(N/O)>-0.6, abundances that are typical of high-redshift NIII]- and NIV]-emitters. This demonstrates that the extreme nitrogen enhancements seen in some NIII]- and NIV]-emitters are only attained during the most extreme starbursts. This suggests that these elevated abundances are caused by enrichment from young massive stars in extreme environments and that the impact of this enrichment pathway is milder, though still important, for high-redshift systems on the star-forming main sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star-forming clumps are a prominent feature of high-redshift galaxies and are thought to trace gravitational fragmentation, feedback, and bulge growth in gas-rich disks. We present a statistical analysis of clump-like structures in $\sim$3600 galaxies spanning $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 8$ from deep JWST/NIRCam imaging in the JADES GOODS--South field. Clumps are identified as residual features after subtracting smooth Sérsic profiles, enabling a uniform, rest-frame optical census of sub-galactic structure. We characterize their physical properties, size--mass relations, and spatial distributions to constrain models of sub-galactic structure formation and evolution. We find that clumps in our sample are typically low-mass ($10^{\sim7-8}M_\odot$), actively star-forming, and show diverse gas-phase metallicity, dust attenuation, and stellar population properties. Their sizes and average pairwise separations increase with cosmic time (toward lower redshift), consistent with inside-out disk growth. The clump mass function follows a power law with slope $\alpha = -1.50_{-0.17}^{+0.19}$, consistent with fragmentation in turbulent disks. We find a deficit of relatively young clumps near galaxy centers and a radial transition in the size--mass relation: outer clumps exhibit steeper, near-virial slopes ($R_{\rm e}\propto M_*^{\sim 0.3}$), while inner clumps follow flatter trends ($R_{\rm e}\propto M_*^{\sim 0.2}$), consistent with structural evolution via migration or disruption. These results provide new constraints on the formation, survival, and dynamical evolution of clumps, highlighting their role in shaping galaxy morphology during the peak of cosmic star formation.
