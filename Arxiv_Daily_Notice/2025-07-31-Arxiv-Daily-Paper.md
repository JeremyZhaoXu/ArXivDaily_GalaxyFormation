 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we define the novel splashback depth $\mathcal{D}$ and width $\mathcal{W}$ to examine how the splashback features of dark matter haloes are affected by the physical properties of haloes themselves. We use the largest simulation run in the hydrodynamic MillenniumTNG project. By stacking haloes in bins of halo mass, redshift, mass-dependent properties such as peak height and concentration, and halo formation history, we measure the shape of the logarithmic slope of the density profile of dark matter haloes. Our results show that the splashback depth has a strong dependence on the halo mass which follows a power law $\mathcal{D}\propto\left(\log_{10}M\right)^{2.8}$. Properties with strong correlation with halo mass demonstrate similar dependence. The splashback width has the strongest dependence on halo peak height and follows a power law $\mathcal{W}\propto\nu^{-0.87}$. We provide the fitting functions of the splashback depth and width in terms of halo mass, redshift, peak height, concentrations and halo formation time. The depth and width are therefore considered to be a long term memory tracker of haloes since they depend more on accumulative physical properties, e.g., halo mass, peak height and halo formation time. They are shaped primarily by the halo's assembly history, which exerts a stronger influence on the inner density profile than short-term dynamical processes. In contrast, the splashback features have little dependence on the short term factors such as halo mass accretion rate and most recent major merger time. The splashback depth and width can therefore be used to complement information gained from quantities like the point of steepest slope or truncation radius to characterise the halo's history and inner structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have become an indispensable tool to understand galaxies. However, computational constraints still severely limit their numerical resolution. This not only restricts the sampling of the stellar component and its direct comparison to detailed observations, but also the precision with which it is evolved. To overcome these problems we introduce the \emph{Superstars} method. This method increases the stellar mass resolution in cosmological galaxy simulations in a computationally inexpensive way for a fixed dark matter and gas resolution without altering any global properties of the simulated galaxies. We demonstrate the \emph{Superstars} method for a Milky Way-like galaxy of the Auriga project, improving the stellar mass resolution by factors of $8$ and $64$. We show and quantify that this improves the sampling of the stellar population in the disc and halo without changing the properties of the central galaxy or its satellites, unlike simulations that change the resolution of all components (gas, dark matter, stars). Moreover, the better stellar mass resolution reduces numerical heating of the stellar disc in its outskirts and keeps substructures in the stellar disc and inner halo more coherent. It also makes lower mass and lower surface brightness structures in the stellar halo more visible. The \emph{Superstars} method is straightforward to incorporate in any cosmological galaxy simulation that does not resolve individual stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of star forming gas can be affected by many physical processes, such as turbulence, gravity, supernova explosions, and magnetic fields. In this paper, we investigate several nearby star forming regions (Orion, Upper Sco, Taurus, and Perseus) for kinematic imprints of these influences on the newly formed stars. Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and APOGEE DR17 radial velocities, we compute first-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) of young stars in galactic Cartesian coordinates in both 6D (3D positions and 3D velocities) and 4D (3D positions and each 1D velocity) to identify signatures of turbulence and anisotropic motion. We also construct 3D and 1D radial velocity profiles to identify coherent expansion trends, and compare stellar proper motions to plane-of-sky magnetic field orientations in Taurus and Perseus. We find that the VSFs are mildly anisotropic, with slightly different amplitudes, slopes, or features in different directions in several groups, but in general, they are all consistent with Larson's Relation at intermediate length scales, especially in less compact groups. In several cases, the VSFs exhibit features suggestive of local energy injection from supernovae. Radial velocity profiles reveal clear anisotropic expansion in multiple groups, with the most extreme cases corresponding to those with the most anisotropic VSFs. In Perseus, we find that the motions of young stars are preferentially perpendicular to the local magnetic field. We find multiple, overlapping causes in each group for the observed kinematics. Our findings support that young stars remember more than just the turbulent state of their natal clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 What is Dark Matter, and what is its concentration in the Milky Way remains an open question in physics. We show that if a significant fraction of dark matter is composed of sub-solar mass primordial black holes (PBHs), gravitational bremsstrahlung resulting from hyperbolic encounters between unbound PBHs within the galactic halos can generate distinctive chromatic gravitational-wave (GW) emission concentrated around the galactic dark matter halo, and it provides a direct window to discover such compact objects. We find that for both generalized NFW and Einasto dark matter profiles of Milky Way, the signal-to-noise ratio can be more than five in one year of observation for the upcoming ground based GW observatories Cosmic Explorer if PBH dark matter fraction $f_{\rm PBH} = 1$ over the mass range $10^{-14} M_\odot \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-8} M_\odot$. Our results show that the Galactic Center could appear as a GW-bright source, enabling new insights into dark matter and its distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the diversity of dark matter (DM) density profiles in a large sample of late-type galaxies from the SPARC database, with the goal of testing whether a cusp-to-core transition occurs across galaxy mass scales. We perform Bayesian fits to high-quality rotation curves using flexible halo models that allow for variations in the inner slopes of DM density profiles. We quantify the central dark matter structure using the surface density within the inner region of the halo, defined as $\Sigma_{\rm DM}(<0.01r_{V_{\rm max}})$, and compare the SPARC galaxies with Milky Way dwarf satellites as well as galaxy groups and clusters. Our results reveal significant diversity in the inner density slopes of SPARC galaxies, ranging from steep cusps to shallow cores, and show that many of them lie below the cuspy profiles predicted by the cold dark matter model, consistent with core-like structures. In contrast, both lower-mass dwarf galaxies and higher-mass galaxy clusters tend to follow the cuspy DM halos. These findings suggest that baryonic feedback may induce a cusp-to-core transition in Milky Way-mass galaxies, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. However, observational limitations and modeling uncertainties still prevent a definitive conclusion. This study provides new empirical insights into the halo mass-dependent nature of DM inner structures and the role of baryonic processes in shaping them.

 - **Abstract**
 Intrinsically faint galaxies at $z\sim2-3$ offer critical insights into early galaxy formation, tracing low-metallicity, low-mass systems during Cosmic Noon and serving as analogs to reionization-era galaxies. We present ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of nine low-luminosity galaxies ($-17 \lesssim M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -20$, $M_\star \lesssim 10^9\,M_\odot$) at $z\sim2.5$ from the CECILIA program, with $\sim$29.5 hr in G235M/F170LP and 1 hr in G395M/F290LP. Our sample includes four LAEs, three rest-UV color-selected galaxies, and two serendipitous detections -- providing the most sensitive rest-optical spectra of individual faint galaxies at this epoch to date. Balmer-line measurements reveal low SFRs ($0.63 < \mathrm{SFR}/(M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < 5.43$) and a broad range of dust reddening ($0 < E(B-V) < 1$), with SFRs systematically below those of continuum-selected galaxies. Electron densities are low ($n_e \lesssim 200$cm$^{-3}$), and emission-line diagnostics indicate low [NII]/H$\alpha$, high [OIII]/H$\beta$, suggesting metallicities $12+\log({\rm O/H})\lesssim8.0$. We also present the first O1-BPT constraints in such faint high-redshift galaxies. Notably, two galaxies show low [OIII]/H$\beta$ despite high Ly$\alpha$ EWs and very low [NII]/H$\alpha$, consistent with the predicted turnover in this ratio at very low metallicities -- highlighting the need for complementary diagnostics (e.g., N2, O32) to identify metal-poor systems. Direct $T_e$-based abundances and expanded samples are needed to further trace metallicity and ionization trends in low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method to differentiate stream-like and shell-like tidal remnants of stellar systems in galactic halos using the density-based approach of the clustering algorithm AstroLink. While previous studies lean on observation, phase-space, and action-space based criteria for stream and shell determination, we introduce AstroLink's ordered-density plot and cluster identification as a viable tool for classification. For a given data set, the AstroLink ordered-density plot reveals the density-based hierarchical clustering structure from which the resultant clusters are identified as being statistically significant overdensities. Using simulations of sub-halo disruptions in an external potential to generate samples of tidal structures, we find that the curvature of the ordered-density plot is positive for stream-like structures and negative for shell-like structures. Comparisons with more standard classification techniques reveal strong agreement on which structures typically fit into stream-like and shell-like categories. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of clustered stream and shell samples in radial phase space and energy-angle space. Given the sensitivity of stellar tidal structures to their host dark matter halos, the identification and subsequent classification of these structures provide exciting avenues of investigation in galactic evolution dynamics and dark matter structure formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern large scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations require robust tools capable of analysing their data outputs in a parallel and efficient manner. We introduce SOAP (Spherical Overdensity and Aperture Processor), a Python package designed to compute halo and galaxy properties from SWIFT simulations after being post-processed with a subhalo finder. SOAP takes a subhalo catalogue as input and calculates a wide array of properties for each object. SOAP offers parallel processing capabilities via mpi4py for efficient handling of large datasets, and allows for consistent property calculation across multiple halo finders. SOAP supports various halo definitions, including spherical overdensities and fixed physical apertures, providing flexibility for diverse observational comparisons. The package is compatible with both dark matter-only and full hydrodynamic simulations, producing HDF5 catalogues that are integrated with the swiftsimio package for seamless unit handling.

 - **Abstract**
 The structure of spiral galaxies is essential to understanding the dynamics and evolution of disc galaxies; however, the precise nature of spiral arms remains uncertain. Two challenges in understanding the mechanisms driving spirals are how galactic environment impacts spiral morphology and how they evolve over time. We present a catalog characterizing the properties, dynamics, and evolution of m=2 spiral structure in 10 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. Consistent with previous literature, we find that FIRE-2 spirals are transient, recurring features simultaneously present in the disc at varying pattern speeds ($\Omega_p$) that broadly decrease with radius. These spirals persist on Gyr timescales (mean duration 1.90 Gyr), but fluctuate in amplitude on timescales of hundreds of Myr. Tidal interactions and bar episodes impact the resulting m=2 spiral structure; strong satellite interactions generally produce shorter-lived, stronger spirals with larger radial extent, and bars can increase $\Omega_p$. Galactic environment influences spiral structure; kinematically colder discs can support longer-lived, stronger spirals. The properties of identified spirals in FIRE-2 vary widely in radial extent (0.3-10.8 kpc), duration (1.00-6.00 Gyr), and amplitudes ($a_{2,\text{max}}$=0.018-0.192). We find the presence of spirals in all age populations, suggesting these are density wave-driven features. This work represents the first time that spiral structure has been cataloged in this manner in cosmological simulations; the catalog can be leveraged with current and forthcoming observational surveys, enabling systematic comparisons to further our understanding of galaxy evolution.
#### JADES-GS-z14-1: A Compact, Faint Galaxy at $z\approx14$ with Weak Metal Lines from Extremely Deep JWST MIRI, NIRCam, and NIRSpec Observations

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has shed light on galaxy formation and metal enrichment within 300 Myr of the Big Bang. While luminous galaxies at $z > 10$ often show significant [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 emission lines, it remains unclear whether such features are prevalent among fainter, more typical galaxies due to observational limits. We present deep imaging and spectroscopy of JADES-GS-z14-1 at $z_\mathrm{spec}=13.86^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, currently the faintest spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at $z\approx 14$. It serendipitously received 70.7 hours of MIRI/F770W imaging in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), the deepest MIRI exposure for any high-redshift galaxy to date. Nonetheless, we detect only tentative F770W emission of $7.9\pm2.8$ nJy at $2.8\sigma$ significance, constraining the total equivalent width of [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 + H$\beta$ to $520^{+400}_{-380}$ A, weaker than most $z > 10$ galaxies with MIRI detections. This source is unresolved across 16 NIRCam bands, implying a physical radius $\lesssim50$ pc. NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy totaling 56 hours reveals no rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines above $3 \sigma$. Stellar population synthesis suggests a stellar mass $\sim4\times 10^{7}$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and a star formation rate $\sim 2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. The absence of strong metal emission lines despite intense star formation suggests a gas-phase metallicity below 10% solar and potentially a high escape fraction of ionizing photons. These deep observations provide rare constraints on faint, early galaxies, tracing the onset of chemical enrichment and ionization in the early Universe.
#### Formation of over-massive black holes in high-redshift disk galaxies via globular cluster accretion

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have suggested the existence of over-massive black holes (OMBHs) in high-redshift galaxies. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism for the formation of OMBHs, based on the accretion of globular clusters (GCs) in compact disk galaxies. We derive the conditions under which OMBHs can form, focusing on key parameters such as halo mass, redshift, and halo spin parameter. Our results show that at redshift $z = 10$, a halo with mass $10^{11}~M_{\odot}$ and a spin parameter of $0.02$ can form a black hole of $1.4 \times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$ through GC migration and accretion via tidal disruption events (TDEs). The resulting black hole-to-stellar mass ratio can reach $\sim 0.1$, corresponding to the fraction of GC mass accreted onto the black hole. This mechanism thus provides a plausible explanation for the OMBHs observed by JWST. Furthermore, by combining our model with halo mass functions and the distribution of spin parameters, we construct black hole mass functions that successfully reproduce the number densities of massive BH candidates at $z \sim 5$ inferred from JWST observations, and UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \sim 10$.
