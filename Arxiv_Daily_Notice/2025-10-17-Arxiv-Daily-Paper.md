 - **Abstract**
 Many state-of-the-art galaxy simulations featuring traditional feedback modes have significant challenges producing enough extended soft X-ray ($\sim 0.5-2$ keV) emission at R $\sim 0.5-1$ R$_{\rm vir}$ observed around galaxies with stellar masses M$_{\rm \ast} \lesssim 10^{11} \rm M_\odot$, without violating galaxy mass function constraints. Moreover, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) measurements probing the thermal pressure of similar galaxies indicate it is orders-of-magnitude lower than predictions from simple halo hydrodynamics and many hydrodynamical simulations. We demonstrate that these constraints can be met congruously with a large non-thermal pressure contribution in the form of cosmic rays (CRs) from SNe and/or AGN, which lowers the tSZ signal while CR leptons produce plentiful soft X-rays via inverse Compton scattering of the CMB. The combination of these two observations is far more constraining on the pressure budget of galactic halos than either alone -- if these novel tSZ and X-ray observations are borne out by future studies, then taken together they reveal \textit{the strongest evidence for CR support in halos to date}. Conversely, it is very difficult to produce the extended X-rays via traditional thermal emission without increasing the overall thermal pressure and thus tSZ signal in tandem, making these tensions even worse. Finally, tSZ \& X-rays together unlock a novel observational method to constrain halo CR pressure relative to thermal pressure, with implications for CR transport parameters and AGN feedback energetics across various galaxy mass scales. Taking the currently observed constraints at M$_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{\rm 12} \rm M_\odot$ imply the halo CR pressure must at least be equal to the gas thermal pressure.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we forecast the number of, and requirements on, N-body simulations needed to train hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) emulators for a range of use cases, using a hybrid of HMcode and perturbation theory as a surrogate model. Our accuracy goals, determined with careful consideration of statistical and systematic uncertainties, are $1\%$ accurate in the high-likelihood range of cosmological parameters, and $2\%$ accurate over a broader parameter space volume for $k<1 h Mpc^{-1}$ and $z<3$. Focusing in part on the 8-parameter $w_0w_a$CDM+$m_\nu$ cosmological model, we find that $<225$ simulations are required to meet our error goals over our wide parameter space, including models with rapidly evolving dark energy, given our simulation and emulator recommendations. For a more restricted parameter space volume, as few as 80 simulations are sufficient. We additionally present simulation forecasts for example use cases, and make the code used in our analyses publicly available. These results offer practical guidance for efficient emulator design and simulation budgeting in future cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the $z=0$ results for the cosmological simulation ASTRID. Hosting $2\times 5500^3\approx$ 0.33 trillion particles in a box of $370\, {\rm Mpc}$ per side, ASTRID is one of the largest cosmological hydrodynamic simulations evolved to $z=0$. ASTRID features a large population of massive black holes (MBHs), covering a wide mass range $4\times10^{4}\sim 2\times 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$. The adopted dynamical friction model provides a relatively accurate description of MBH dynamics, making ASTRID a powerful tool to study MBH growth and mergers in a cosmological context. ASTRID successfully captures the co-evolution of MBHs and their host galaxies, producing $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ and $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relations in good agreement with observations. Notably, ASTRID generates scatter in these relations that is more consistent with observations than previous simulations, indicating a more realistic MBH diversity. The galaxy stellar mass function at $z=0$ is generally consistent with observational constraints. When dust attenuation is applied, the galaxy luminosity function also agrees well with observations, and the bimodality in galaxy colors is reproduced as well. ASTRID hosts a large population of massive galaxy groups and clusters: 7 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}>10^{15}\ M_{\odot}$, and 9709 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}>10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$. We quantify the stellar mass content in these halos, and find that the correlations between the stellar and halo mass match well with observational constraints. Finally, we present the $z=0$ power spectra of MBH and galaxies, as well as their bias with respect to the matter power spectrum. We find that MBHs with $M_{\rm BH}\geq 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$ and galaxies with $M_{\star}\geq 10^{10.5}\ M_{\odot}$ serve as good tracers of large-scale structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) and their associated stellar streams are key tracers of the hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way. $\omega$ Centauri, the most massive and chemically complex GC in the Galaxy, is widely believed to be the remnant nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Identifying its associated debris and that of chemically similar clusters can provide important constraints on the nature of this progenitor system. We aim to identify field stars that are chemically and kinematically linked to $\omega$ Cen and to a group of globular clusters associated with the Nephele accretion event. We analyse APOGEE DR17 data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in a 8-dimensional chemical space to identify field stars whose abundances match those of $\omega$ Cen. We then compute the orbital energy and angular momentum of these stars and apply a second GMM, calibrated on simulations from the e-TidalGCs project, to determine kinematic compatibility with the predicted streams of $\omega$ Cen and the associated Nephele GCs. We identify 470 stars chemically compatible with $\omega$ Cen, of which 58 are also Al-rich, consistent with second-generation stars found in GCs. Of these, 6 stars show kinematics consistent with the predicted $\omega$ Cen stream, and additional stars are linked to the tidal streams of NGC 6205, NGC 6254, NGC 6273, NGC 6656, and NGC 6809. We also find overlap in chemical and kinematic properties between Nephele stars and the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus population. Our findings indicate stellar debris linked to $\omega$ Cen and its candidate globular cluster family, consistent with a shared, now-disrupted galactic progenitor. Despite residual uncertainties from disc contamination and limited sky coverage, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of combined chemical and dynamical analyses in uncovering relics of past accretion events in the inner Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolved cosmological matter density field is fully determined by the initial matter density field at fixed cosmological parameters. However, the two-dimensional cosmological projected matter density field, relevant for weak-lensing and photometric galaxy studies, is fully determined by the initial projected matter density field only at the linear order. At non-linear order, the entire volume of initial matter contributes. We study a model for the evolved projected density field that is deterministic in the initial projected density fields and probabilistic in the effects of the remaining modes in the initial conditions. We write down predictions for the mean evolved projected field model using Lagrangian perturbation theory. We run a suite of small N-body simulations with fixed projected initial conditions and measure the statistical properties of the ensemble of evolved projected fields. Measurements and theory are in good agreement and show that the information on the initial projected fields is exponentially suppresses on non-linear scales. Our model offers a potential approach to a field-level likelihood of projected fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a measurement of the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxy sample overlapping with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) CMB temperature map. Our analysis makes use of $1.6$ million galaxies with stellar masses $\log M_\star/M_\odot > 10$, and we explore measurements across a range of aperture sizes ($2.1' < \theta_{\rm ap} < 3.5'$) and stellar mass selections. This statistic directly probes the velocity field of the large-scale structure, a unique observable of cosmic dynamics and modified gravity. In particular, at low redshifts, this quantity is especially interesting, as deviations from General Relativity are expected to be largest. Notably, our result represents the highest-significance low-redshift ($z \sim 0.3$) detection of the kSZ pairwise effect yet. In our most optimal configuration ($\theta_{\rm ap} = 3.3'$, $\log M_\star > 11$), we achieve a $5\sigma$ detection. Assuming that an estimate of the optical depth and galaxy bias of the sample exists via e.g., external observables, this measurement constrains the fundamental cosmological combination $H_0 f \sigma_8^2$. A key challenge is the degeneracy with the galaxy optical depth. We address this by combining CMB lensing, which allows us to infer the halo mass and galaxy population properties, with hydrodynamical simulation estimates of the mean optical depth, $\bar \tau$. We stress that this is a proof-of-concept analysis; with BGS DR2 data we expect to improve the statistical precision by roughly a factor of two, paving the way toward robust tests of modified gravity with kSZ-informed velocity-field measurements at low redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Time domain surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are projected to annually discover millions of astronomical transients. This and complementary programs demand fast, automated methods to constrain the physical properties of the most interesting objects for spectroscopic follow up. Traditional approaches to likelihood-based inference are computationally expensive and ignore the multi-component energy sources powering astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we present a hierarchical simulation-based inference model for multi-band light curves that 1) identifies the energy sources powering an event of interest, 2) infers the physical properties of each subclass, and 3) separates physical anomalies in the learned embedding space. Our architecture consists of a transformer-based light curve summarizer coupled to a flow-matching regression module and a categorical classifier for the physical components. We train and test our model on $\sim$150k synthetic light curves generated with $\texttt{MOSFiT}$. Our network achieves a 90% classification accuracy at identifying energy sources, yields well-calibrated posteriors for all active components, and detects rare anomalies such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) through the learned latent space. This work demonstrates a scalable joint framework for population studies of known transients and the discovery of novel populations in the era of Rubin.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation to study the properties of supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least one CW with signal-to-noise ratio $>3$ to be $4\%$ ($20\%$) for EPTA (SKA)-like sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range $0.05-1$, with chirp masses of $10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$, hosted mainly in quiescent massive galaxies residing in halos of mass $\sim 10^{13}\, M_\odot$. CW candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with $f_{\rm Edd}>10^{-3}$ can still outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower slopes and higher amplitudes at $f=1/\rm yr$, thereby reducing the apparent tension between astrophysical expectations and PTA observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent long-term radio monitoring of tidal disruption events (TDEs) suggests that radio afterglows are common. Most studies argue that these afterglows may arise from forward shocks (FS) produced by the interaction between the TDE outflow and the hot, diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM). Current theoretical models do not model the evolution of relativistic electrons in space, which introduces uncertainties. Here we conducted hydrodynamic simulations to study the hydrodynamic evolution of relativistic electrons, and calculated the synchrotron spectra via radiative transfer. We focus on the FS scenario with non-relativistic outflows, and various parameters of the outflow and CNM are explored. A moderate outflow with kinetic energy of several $10^{50}$ erg in a Galactic center - like CNM can produce mJy-level radio afterglows at a distance of 100 Mpc. The self-absorption frequency exhibits a slow decline at early times and a rapid decrease at late times. We derived the temporal evolution of the high-frequency radio flux, revealing its characteristic rise and decline pattern. We also find that: (1) the radio spectra for narrow outflows are clearly anisotropic along different sight lines; (2) the FS parameters inferred from radio spectra using conventional analytical formulas deviate significantly from those in simulations, in which the inferred shock radii are half of those from simulations, and the inferred energies are an order of magnitude lower.
#### CHILLING: Continuum Halos in LVHIS Local Irregular Nearby Galaxies - Radio continuum spectral behavior of dwarf galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies, due to their shallow gravitational potentials, provide critical environments for studying feedback mechanisms from star formation and its impacts on dwarf galaxy evolution. In particular, radio continuum (RC) observations offer valuable insights into cosmic ray dynamics, which play a significant role in shaping these processes. This study investigates the detectability and spectral characteristics of RC emission in a sample of 15 dwarf galaxies (11 gas-rich, star forming dwarfs and 4 blue compact dwarfs) spanning a broad range of stellar masses and star formation histories. Using multi-band RC data (L/S-, C-, and X-band) from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyse the physical conditions responsible for RC emission and explore the dominant emission mechanisms within these systems. RC emission is detected in 11 out of the 15 galaxies. Our results indicate that RC emission correlates strongly with star formation rate, far-infrared, and stellar mass, while dynamic parameters such as HI and rotational velocity exhibit no significant correlation with RC detectability. Spectral analysis reveals that the RC spectral energy distribution in these galaxies frequently deviate from a simple power-law behavior, instead displaying curvature that suggests more complex underlying physical processes. Statistical model comparison confirms that a single power-law model is inadequate to capture the observed spectral shapes, emphasising the necessity of more sophisticated approaches. Additionally, the observed radio-far-infrared correlation indicates that cosmic ray electrons in lower-mass dwarf galaxies cool more rapidly than they can escape (e.g. via galactic winds), resulting in a measurable RC deficit.
#### Stellar population astrophysics (SPA) with the TNG. The Phosphorus abundance on the young side of MilkyWay

 - **Abstract**
 We present phosphorus abundance measurements for a total of 102 giant stars, including 82 stars in 24 open clusters and 20 Cepheids, based on high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained with GIANO-B. Evolution of phosphorus abundance, despite its astrophysical and biological significance, remains poorly understood due to a scarcity of observational data. By combining precise stellar parameters from the optical, a robust line selection and measurement method, we measure phosphorus abundances using available P I lines. Our analysis confirms a declining trend in [P/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H] around solar metallicity for clusters and Cepheids, consistent with previous studies. We also report a [P/Fe]-age relation among open clusters older than 1 Gyr, indicating a time-dependent enrichment pattern. Such pattern can be explained by the different stellar formation history of their parental gas, with more efficient stellar formation in the gas of older clusters (thus with higher phosphorus abundances). [P/Fe] shows a flat trend among cepheids and clusters younger than 1 Gyr (along with three Cepheids inside open clusters), possibly hinting at the phosphorus contribution from the previous-generation low-mass stars. Such trend suggests that the young clusters share a nearly common chemical history, with a mild increase in phosphorus production by low-mass stars.
#### Multi-wavelength analysis of the progenitor of GRB 230307A via Bayesian model comparison

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 230307A is one of the brightest long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) ever detected, yet its progenitor remains uncertain due to the variety of plausible astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we investigate four possible progenitors for GRB 230307A: a binary neutron star (BNS), a neutron star--white dwarf (NS--WD) system, a neutron star--black hole (NS--BH) merger, and a tidal disruption event (TDE) involving a white dwarf and a supermassive black hole. Additionally, we explore three distinct central engine models powering the kilonova associated with the BNS: radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei in a two-component ejecta model, a magnetar-driven model including magnetic dipole spin-down, and a combined model of magnetar spin-down with ${}^{56}$Ni radioactive decay. We perform Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve analyses using physically motivated models and priors, and evaluate model performance through Bayes factors and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores. Our results show a statistical preference for a BNS or NS--WD progenitor producing a kilonova powered by a magnetar and ${}^{56}$Ni decay, characterized by a ${}^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim4\times10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $0.06\,M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, under the assumption of a BNS origin within this model, we infer binary component masses of $m_{1} = 1.81^{+0.46}_{-0.61}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{2} = 1.61^{+0.65}_{-0.41}\,M_{\odot}$, with a dimensionless tidal deformability of $\tilde{\Lambda} = 471^{+318}_{-395}$. From the component mass posteriors, we infer that the observed offset can be explained by a natal kick as long as the systemic velocity is nearly aligned with the pre-kick orbital motion. In this case, the required kick velocity (co-moving frame) and binary separation range within $v'_{\mathrm{k}}\sim100$--$150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, and $a_0\sim2$--$3~R_{\odot}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming galaxy surveys will bring a wealth of information about the clustering of matter, but modeling small-scale structure beyond $\Lambda$CDM remains computationally challenging. While accurate $N$-body emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum for $\Lambda$CDM and some limited extensions, it's unfeasible to generate $N$-body simulation suites for all candidate models. Motivated by recent hints of an evolving dark energy equation of state, we assess the viability of employing the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method to generate simulation suites for the $w_0w_a$ dark energy model. We combine COLA simulations with an existing high-precision $\Lambda$CDM emulator to extend its predictions into new regions of parameter space. We assess the precision of our emulator at the level of the matter power spectrum, finding that our emulator can reproduce the nonlinear boosts from EuclidEmulator2 at less than $2\%$ error. Moreover, we perform an analysis of a simulated cosmic shear survey akin to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) first year of observations, assessing the differences in parameter constraints between our COLA-based emulator and the benchmark emulator. We find our emulator to be in excellent agreement with the benchmark, achieving less than $0.3\sigma$ shifts in cosmological parameters. We compare our emulator's performance to a commonly used approach: assuming the $\Lambda$CDM boost can be employed for extended parameter spaces without modification. We find that our emulator yields a significantly smaller $\Delta\chi^2$ distribution, parameter constraint biases, and a more accurate figure of merit compared to this second approach. Our results demonstrate that COLA emulators provide a computationally efficient path forward for modeling nonlinear structure in extended cosmologies, offering a practical alternative to full $N$-body suites.

 - **Abstract**
 For the first time, we show in MHD simulations with cosmological initial conditions that bi-lobed gamma-ray outflows similar to the Fermi bubbles can form from star formation and supernova feedback, without involvement from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We use simulations run with full MHD and dynamical, on-the-fly multi-species cosmic ray transport in MeV-TeV energy bins to model gamma-ray emission in Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies from neutral pion decay, relativistic non-thermal Bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering. We find that these gamma-ray outflows are present in all three Milky-Way mass simulated galaxies. The amplitude, shape, and the composition of the gamma-ray spectrum of these bubbles fluctuates over time, with lepton-dominated and hadron-dominated phases. Spectra in which there is O(1) more gamma-ray flux from inverse Compton scattering than neutral pion decay are a good fit to the measured Fermi-LAT spectrum. Additionally, these simulations predict multi-wavelength features in soft x-rays and synchrotron radio, potentially providing new observational signatures that can connect the circumgalactic medium to cosmic ray physics and activity in the galactic center.

 - **Abstract**
 We apply the automatic stellar stream detection algorithm StarStream to Gaia Data Release 3 and identify 87 stellar streams associated with Galactic globular clusters (GCs), including 34 high-quality cases with median completeness and purity both exceeding 50%, as estimated from modeling mock streams. These detections double the number of known GC streams, and increase the fraction of GCs with tidal streams at high Galactic latitudes (|b| > 30 degree) to 75%. In contrast to visual expectations, many new streams are wide or short, or misaligned with their progenitors' orbits. Taking advantage of the unbiased density measurements enabled by our method, we also estimate the mass loss rate for the progenitor GCs. We find that several low-mass, large-size clusters have enhanced mass loss rates, indicating that they are approaching complete tidal disruption.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia mission has led to the discovery of over 100 stellar streams in the Milky Way, most of which likely originated from globular clusters (GCs). As the upcoming wide-field surveys can potentially continue to increase the number of known streams, there is a growing need to shift focus from manual detection of individual streams to automated detection methods that prioritize both quality and quantity. Traditional techniques rely heavily on the visual expectation that GC streams are dynamically cold and thin. This assumption does not hold for all streams, whose morphologies and kinematics can vary significantly with the progenitor's mass and orbit. As a result, these methods are biased toward a subset of the whole stream population, with often unquantified purity and completeness. In this work, we present StarStream, an automatic stream detection algorithm based on a physics-inspired model rather than visual expectation. Our method provides a more accurate prediction of stream stars in the multi-dimensional space of observables, while using fewer free parameters to account for the diversity of streams. Applied to a mock GC stream catalog tailored for the Gaia DR3 dataset, our algorithm achieves both purity and completeness of at least 65% at Galactic latitudes |b| > 30 degree.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing is an invaluable probe of the nature of dark matter, and the structures it forms. Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for unparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to the precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of the entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly lensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos: \emph{i)} through higher order caustics generating high relative magnification ($\mu_r > 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the caustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for $\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models, and \emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images, which occur for $\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find that these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in our simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of low-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in lensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction integral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We also report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the distributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo populations with increased number densities or concentrations. With the upcoming detection of strongly lensed events by ground- and space- based detectors, comparisons against these simulated distributions will provide insight into the nature of dark matter.
