 - **Abstract**
 We present the stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and mass-metallicity-star formation relation ("fundamental metallicity relation"; FMR) of 18 massive (log(M/M$_\odot$) = 9.5-11) main-sequence galaxies at z~5 from the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample. This sample complements recent studies by JWST at up to two orders of magnitude lower stellar masses. The metallicities are derived using strong optical lines, and verified by temperature-based oxygen abundance measurements for five galaxies for which faint auroral lines are detected. We find little evolution at the massive end of the MZR between z~5 and cosmic noon at z~2, suggesting a fast metal enrichment at early times. The FMR at z=5 exhibits a 5x larger scatter (preferentially to lower metallicities) compared the local FMR relation. This scatter can be explained by a bursty star formation and the direct build-up of metals in early galaxies as well as differences in age and outflow efficiencies. Capitalizing on all available samples, we find that the observed MZR and FMR over three orders of stellar mass is generally in good agreement with results from cosmological simulation, although some underestimate the metal enrichment at low stellar masses. This may be due to too efficient metal-rich outflows. We show that the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST galaxies likely joined the current FMR at z~10 and will evolve into massive (log(M/M$_\odot$)~11.4) galaxies with super-solar metallicities by z=0.
#### The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: JWST/IFU Optical Observations for 18 Main-Sequence Galaxies at z=4-6

 - **Abstract**
 To fully characterize the formation and evolution of galaxies, we need to observe their stars, gas, and dust on resolved spatial scales. We present the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST survey, which combines kpc-resolved imaging and spectroscopy from HST, JWST, and ALMA for 18 representative main-sequence galaxies at z=4-6 and log(M/$M_\odot$) > 9.5 to study their star formation, chemical properties, and extended gas reservoirs. The co-spatial measurements resolving the ionized gas, molecular gas, stars, and dust on 1-2 kpc scales make this a unique benchmark sample for the study of galaxy formation and evolution at z~5, connecting the Epoch of Reionization with the cosmic noon. In this paper, we outline the survey goals and sample selection, and present a summary of the available data for the 18 galaxies. In addition, we measure spatially integrated quantities (such as global gas metallicity), test different star formation rate indicators, and quantify the presence of H$\alpha$ halos. Our targeted galaxies are relatively metal rich (10-70% solar), complementary to JWST samples at lower stellar mass, and there is broad agreement between different star formation indicators. One galaxy has the signature of an active galactic nuclei (AGN) based on its emission line ratios. Six show broad H$\alpha$ emission suggesting type 1 AGN candidates. We conclude with an outlook on the exciting science that will be pursued with this unique sample in forthcoming papers.

 - **Abstract**
 There exist extremely massive spiral galaxies in isolated environments, with stellar masses several times that of the Milky Way, yet their star formation rates (SFRs) are comparable to or even lower than that of the Milky Way. In this paper, we investigate the molecular gas properties of such galaxies to better understand the origin of their low SFRs. We present IRAM 30m CO observations of five extremely massive spirals from the CGM-MASS sample. We compare their star formation efficiencies (SFEs) with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and find that these massive spirals generally exhibit low efficiency in converting molecular gas into stars. We further compare their molecular gas masses with their atomic gas and stellar masses, and also include the CHANG-ES sample galaxies observed with the IRAM 30m telescope in a similar manner for comparison. Our sample galaxies show low efficiency in converting atomic to molecular gas and have lower molecular gas fractions, suggesting that their suppressed star formation stems from both limited gas supply and inefficient star formation. Considering potential cold gas sources in massive spirals, we argue that their current reservoirs likely originate from past starburst or merger events rather than ongoing accretion in present isolated environments. Finally, we examine the location of these galaxies on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, finding them baryon-deficient and deviating from the trend of lower-mass galaxies. This suggests either a significant undetected baryonic component or a flattening/turnover of the relation at the high-mass end, consistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present TUNA, a Vision-Transformer based network adapted from segmentation to flux regression for faint, diffuse radio emission. Trained on LOFAR-like mock observations derived from cosmological simulations, TUNA accurately reconstructs low surface-brightness structures, with only mild smoothing and small brightness-dependent biases. Applied to LOFAR data of the A399 - A401 galaxy cluster system, it recovers the ridge not identifiable in the high resolution observation and matches the low resolution tapered map. These results indicate how TUNA can deliver automated, quantitative surface brightness estimates for diffuse extragalactic sources, enabling scalable analyses for upcoming surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids, vast underdensities in the large-scale structure, offer unique sensitivity to cosmological parameters. However, traditional 3D galaxy-based void finding is limited by many factors, including uncertainties in the galaxy-halo connection and distortions from redshift errors. Using alternative tracers and new 2D void definitions can alleviate these limitations and be tailored to maximise the signal for specific observables. Here, we introduce Cosmic Tunnels, a new class of 2D void-like objects traced by galaxy clusters, corresponding to large underdense lines of sight. We identify Cosmic Tunnels by applying the tunnel algorithm to the RASS-MCMF and ACT-MCMF cluster catalogues. We validate their void-like nature by measuring the cross-correlation of Cosmic Tunnels with galaxy density contrast maps from the DESI Legacy Survey (measured at 63$\sigma$ significance), galaxy weak-lensing maps from DES Y3 (31$\sigma$), and CMB weak-lensing maps from ACT DR6 (15$\sigma$), all of which show underdense interiors enclosed by compensation ridges, consistent with 3D galaxy voids, measured at high statistical significance. We also show that the lensing profiles fit the universal HSW void profile, further validating their void-like nature. We cross-correlate the Cosmic Tunnels with Planck CMB temperature maps to measure the ISW signal. Using the ACT-MCMF Cosmic Tunnels, we achieve a 3.6$\sigma$ ISW detection, one of the highest significances ever reported from a single tracer catalogue. These results confirm that Cosmic Tunnels are robust underdense structures and demonstrate their potential as a new tool for cosmological analyses. Finally, we report a tentative detection of a sign flip in the ISW signal at very low redshift (z<0.03), consistent with previous studies, challenging the standard $\Lambda\rm{CDM}$ paradigm.
#### Compact vs. Scattered: Suitability of Southern 6.7GHz Methanol Masers for VLBI astrometry

 - **Abstract**
 The 6.7~GHz methanol maser transition is exclusively associated with young, high-mass stars and represents a potential target for astrometric studies, including accurate determination of their distance through trigonometric parallax measurements. There are more than 1000 known 6.7~GHz methanol maser sources in the Milky Way; however, not all are suitable targets for astrometric measurements. We have used the Long Baseline Array to observe 187 southern 6.7~GHz methanol masers and identify 69 sources with one or more maser spots that are sufficiently compact and intense to be suitable targets for very long baseline interferometry astrometry with current instruments. Maser compactness appears to be a strong function of Galactic position, with masers that are likely in nearby spiral arms being more compact, while those associated with distant arms or the central Galactic region being less compact - a relationship we associate with scatter broadening. This has implications for astrophysical masers, especially distant ones employed for Galactic astrometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Due to wave interference, an ultralight light dark matter halo has stochastic, granular substructures which can scatter stars, leading to the heating of stellar distributions. Studies of this phenomenon have placed lower bounds on the ultralight dark matter mass. In this paper we investigate a number of relevant systematic effects, including: (1) the heating by the central soliton, (2) the self-gravity of the stars, (3) the suppression of heating in a tidally stripped halo, and (4) the tidal field suppression of heating when the stellar cluster is much smaller than the de Broglie wavelength. The first three effects are quantified by studying the dynamics of stellar particles in Schrodinger-Poisson simulations of ultralight dark matter halos, while the last effect is studied using analytic approximations.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube neutrino observatory has been successfully operating in its full configuration for almost 15 years and is characterized by a remarkably high stability and uptime. During this time, it has made many groundbreaking observations, such as the first detection of a high-energy diffuse cosmic neutrino flux or, more recently, the identification of the AGN NGC1068 as a steady source of high-energy neutrino emission and the observation of neutrinos from the Milky Way. In this talk, new developments in these areas will be discussed and further highlights presented. The second part then looks at the ongoing developments at the South Pole with IceCube Upgrade and IceCube-Gen2 and discusses their potential for advancing neutrino and astroparticle physics.

 - **Abstract**
 In the coming years, detailed chemical abundances from large-scale high-resolution spectroscopic surveys will become available for vast numbers of stars across the Milky Way. Previous work has suggested that abundance ratios from these spectra can allow us to estimate ages from a large number of stars. These data will be leveraged to calibrate chemical clocks to age-date field stars, as reliable stellar ages remain elusive. In this work, we extended our empirical relationship between stellar age and their carbon-to-nitrogen ([C/N]) abundance ratio for evolved stars to older and more metal-poor stars by combining the original open cluster calibration sample and four globular clusters: 47 Tuc, M 71, M 4, and M 5. With this extension, [C/N] can be used as a chemical clock for evolved field stars to investigate not only regions within the metal rich disk, but also more metal-poor regions of our Galaxy. We have established the [C/N]-age relationship for APOGEE DR17 red giant stars, that have experienced the first dredge up but have not yet undergone any extra-mixing, in clusters usable for ages between $8.62 \leq \log(Age[{\rm yr}]) \leq 10.13$ and for metallicites of $-1.2\leq[Fe/H]\leq+0.3$. This relationship can be uniformly applied to these stars within the APOGEE DR17 sample. This measured [C/N]-age APOGEE DR17 relationship is also shown to be consistent with stellar ages derived from asterosiesmic results of APOKASC and APO-K2.
#### Relics of High-redshift Compaction in our Backyard: The Most Metal-poor Stars in the Proto-Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 The earliest assembly of the Milky Way (MW) remains poorly understood, yet the spatial, chemical, and kinematic properties of its most metal-poor stars provide a unique fossil record of its proto-Galaxy phase. Understanding how this ancient component formed is essential for linking near-field Galactic archaeology to high-redshift galaxy evolution. We construct the currently largest 3-D map of inner-Galaxy metal-poor giants by combining several narrow/medium-band photometric surveys, reaching metallicities down to [Fe/H]$\sim-$3.5. Comparing observational data with Auriga 18 (Au18) from the Auriga cosmological simulations, we find that the proto-Galaxy population ([Fe/H]$\lesssim-$1.4) is highly centrally concentrated within the Galactocentric distance $r_{\rm gc}\lesssim$15 kpc, and forms a dispersion-supported structure with negligible rotation. The spatial and chemo-dynamical properties of observed proto-Galaxy population closely match those of the metal-poor stars in Au18. Considering Au18 as an analog of the MW, we propose a new scenario in which the formation of the proto-Galaxy is linked, for the first time, to episodes of high-z (z$\gtrsim$3) gas compaction, blue-nugget phases, and quenching processes. This framework provides a unified physical picture for the first $\sim$1-2 Gyr of the MW's evolution, bridging local fossil records with future studies of early star-forming galaxies.
#### A search for black holes with metal-poor stellar companions: I. Survey sample selection and single epoch radial velocity follow-up

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) above $30 M_\odot$ are predicted to form from low-metallicity progenitors, but direct detections of such systems in the Milky Way remain scarce. Motivated by the recent discovery of Gaia BH3, a $33 M_\odot$ BH with a very metal-poor giant companion, we conduct a systematic search for additional systems. Approximately 900 candidates are identified with Gaia as having significant deviations from single-star astrometric motion, evidence of RV variability, and low metallicities inferred from Gaia XP spectra. We obtain single epoch high-resolution spectra for over 600 of these sources with Magellan/MIKE and Lick/APF and measure independent RVs with $\approx 1$ km s$^{-1}$ precision. After removing contaminants such as hot stars, pulsators, eclipsing binaries, and hierarchical triples, we identify about 15 promising candidates with large RV amplitudes or offsets from the Gaia reported values. This program establishes a well-characterized sample of BH candidates for detailed orbital modeling once Gaia DR4 epoch astrometry and RVs are released in late 2026; multi-epoch RV follow-up is ongoing. Together, the Gaia and ground-based data will place new constraints on the demographics of BHs with metal-poor companions and test theoretical predictions linking low metallicity to the formation of the most massive stellar remnants.
