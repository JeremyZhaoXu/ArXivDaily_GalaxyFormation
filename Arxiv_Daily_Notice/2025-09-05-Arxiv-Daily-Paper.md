 - **Abstract**
 The orbits of stars around Sgr A*, the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, provide a unique laboratory for testing its environment with unprecedented precision. In this work, we compute the apsidal precession induced by extended matter distributions through Lagrange's equations and compare it with the measured precession of S2, reproducing and extending GRAVITY's constraints. In particular, we push bounds on boson clouds to larger gravitational couplings $\alpha$ and to the second-fastest superradiant mode. We also show that environments with mass of order $1\%$ of Sgr A* drive stellar orbits to decay by dynamical friction within a few Myr. The inner star cluster is however efficiently replenished, masking this effect observationally. We also show that orbital resonances from boson clouds have no impact on relevant timescales. While S2 currently provides the cleanest dataset, our framework is readily applicable to other stars that we identify as particularly promising, whose orbits will be measured with increasing accuracy, opening up new opportunities to probe the environment of Sgr A*.
#### Breaking Down the $\textsf{CosmoGEMS}$: Toward Modeling and Understanding Globular Cluster Stellar Streams in a Fully Cosmological Context

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation surveys are expected to uncover thousands of globular cluster (GC) stellar streams, motivating the need for a theoretical framework that produces realistic GC streams in a fully cosmological, Milky Way-like environment. We present $\textsf{CosmoGEMS}$, a star-by-star cosmological GC stream framework that self-consistently links small-scale cluster physics with large-scale Galactic dynamics. The initial phase-space positions of stream stars are informed by post-processed GC populations within the FIRE cosmological simulation. Escaped stars are orbit-integrated from their time of escape to the present day in a time-evolving Galactic potential extracted from the same simulation using a basis function expansion. We explore two example streams on different orbits. One forms a long, thin stream with a velocity dispersion consistent with Milky Way GC streams. However, it exhibits a clump and orbital-phase-dependent misalignments due to the evolving potential. The other stream develops both a thin component and a diffuse, shell-like structure, similar to features observed in streams like Jhelum. These results highlight the power of fully cosmological models in producing realistic stream morphologies and kinematics. Unlike idealized simulations, our models naturally incorporate time-dependent changes in the progenitor's orbit, including orbital plane evolution, which significantly affects stream structure. This challenges common assumptions in stream-finding algorithms and interpretation. $\textsf{CosmoGEMS}$ provides a key step toward connecting future stellar stream observations with the physics of globular cluster evolution and hierarchical galaxy formation in a cosmological context.
#### Deciphering galaxy images using machine vision

 - **Abstract**
 We present a machine vision approach to quantify galaxy structure combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework with principal component analysis (PCA). Using mock gri-band images from the EAGLE simulation, the VAE finds that 35 features are needed to describe images. Adding the PCA, we identify an optimal range of 10-12 features needed to capture 99.9 per cent of the variance in galaxy morphology. The exact optimal number varies with galaxy complexity: disk-dominated galaxies require 12 features, bulge-dominated galaxies need 9, and intermediate systems require 10-11 features. Correlations between extracted PCA features and structural measurements reveal that the VAE prioritizes galaxy size during reconstruction, with half-light radius strongly correlating with the highest-ranked principal components. Subsequent features capture morphology-dependent characteristics: disk-dominated galaxies emphasize size, asymmetry, and position angle; bulge-dominated systems focus on size, concentration, and axis ratio; while intermediate galaxies show enhanced attention to Sérsic index, indicating greater emphasis on accurately reproducing both disk and bulge structures. The PCA process significantly reduces the entanglement of the features compared to the raw VAE latent features, decreasing the correlations with the half-light radius and the Sérsic index from 14.5\pm1.0 and 6.0\pm1.5 features, respectively, to only 2.0\pm1.0 components after PCA. Using UMAP technique, we construct 2D visualizations that preserve neighborhood relationships from the high-dimensional feature space. This demonstrates that machine vision can effectively distinguish galaxy populations across different morphological types, including systems with atypical structures that may be overlooked by traditional classification methods, providing a data-driven complement to conventional structural measurements.
#### New Interpretation for the Orientation of the LMC's Gaseous Arms B and E using ULLYSES

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) experiences disruption from tidal and ram-pressure forces as it travels through the halo of the Milky Way. In this project, we combine radio emission-line observations from the GASS and GASKAP surveys with UV absorption-line observations from the HST Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program to trace the material in front of the LMC. Along our 8 stellar sightlines near 30 Doradus, we observe gaseous structures likely associated with two arm-like features flowing in and around the LMC's disk. We detect the nearside gas in neutral, low, and medium ionization species. The lower-ionization species likely undergo both thermal and non-thermal broadening while the moderately-ionized phase is influenced by more non-thermal processes. The total integrated column density of AlIII decreases with increasing angular offset from 30 Doradus, with sightlines within 0.25 degrees containing more moderately ionized gas. We demonstrate from a Gaussian decomposition technique on the HI emission that both arms likely trace an additional 1.0 degree in Galactic longitude toward the 30 Doradus region than previously predicted. We constrain the orientation of the arms by suggesting that they likely converge around (l,b) =(280.5$^\circ$, -31.2$^\circ$) and at least partially cross in front of the LMC. Our observations are consistent with two competing origins of the arms: 1) outflowing material is swept back by tidal and ram-pressure forces or 2) tidally stripped inflows fuel the ongoing stellar activity inside the LMC. Future studies are needed to distinguish between these scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Most baryons in present-day galaxy clusters exist as hot gas ($\boldsymbol{\gtrsim10^7\,\rm}\mathrm{K}$), forming the intracluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that the mass and temperature of the ICM rapidly decrease with increasing cosmological redshift, as intracluster gas in younger clusters is still accumulating and being heated. The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect arises when cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are scattered to higher energies through interactions with energetic electrons in hot ICM, leaving a localized decrement in the CMB at a long wavelength. The depth of this decrement is a measure of the thermal energy and pressure of the gas. To date, the effect has been detected in only three systems at or above $z\sim2$, when the Universe was 4 billion years old, making the time and mechanism of ICM assembly uncertain. Here, we report observations of this effect in the protocluster SPT2349$-$56 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SPT2349$-$56 contains a large molecular gas reservoir, with at least 30 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and three radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a 100-kpc region at $z=4.3$, corresponding to 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang. The observed tSZ signal implies a thermal energy of $\mathbf{\sim 10^{61}\,\mathrm{erg}}$, exceeding the possible energy of a virialized ICM by an order of magnitude. Contrary to current theoretical expectations, the strong tSZ decrement in SPT2349$-$56 demonstrates that substantial heating can occur and deposit a large amount of thermal energy within growing galaxy clusters, overheating the nascent ICM in unrelaxed structures, two billion years before the first mature clusters emerged at $\mathbf{z \sim 2}$.
#### Rubin Data Preview 1: Extending the View of Unresolved Binary Stars in 47 Tucanae

 - **Abstract**
 Until now, the study of unresolved main sequence binary stars in globular clusters has been possible almost exclusively in their central regions with deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. We present the first detection of unresolved main-sequence binary stars in the outer field of 47 Tucanae using Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1). Our analysis exploits deep $i$ vs. $g-i$ colour-magnitude diagrams beyond the cluster's half-light radius, reaching almost to the tidal radius. The high-quality photometry allowed to identify unresolved binaries with mass ratios $q$ larger than 0.7. The derived binary fraction of $f_\mathrm{bin}(q>0.7) = 0.016 \pm 0.005$ stands in contrast to the significantly lower values in the cluster innermost regions, as measured from HST photometry. This result provides new empirical input for testing physical processes that drive the formation and evolution of binary stars in globular clusters. It also demonstrates Rubin's unique wide-field and high-precision photometric capabilities to address a broader range of outstanding questions in star cluster research. Future full data releases will enable to significantly expand the study of dense stellar systems across the Milky Way.
#### Reduced Gas Accretion onto Galaxies due to Effects of External Giant Radio Lobes

 - **Abstract**
 Suppression effects of giant radio lobes from supermassive black holes on gas accretion onto galaxies in the surrounding regions are quantified using cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. With an appropriate amount of radio jet energy injected into the intergalactic medium following the formation peak of supermassive black holes at redshift two, we find that galaxies in the greater neighborhood of the jet-launching massive galaxies subsequently experience a significant reduction in the amount of accreted gas. The distribution of the resulting magnetic field in the intergalactic medium is highly inhomogeneous, due to the highly biased nature of the most massive supermassive black holes. In regions with magnetic field strength $B>10^{-2}\mu$G, the baryon fraction is on average reduced by 17%, 14%, and 12%, respectively, for halos of mass in the range of $[10^{11}-10^{12})\msun$, $[10^{12}-10^{13})\msun$, and $[10^{13}-10^{14})\msun$. A proper inclusion of this new, external, global, preventive feedback mechanism from AGN in the next generation of cosmological simulation may be necessary.
#### Generation of Lognormal Synthetic Lyman-$α$ Forest Spectra for $P_{1D}$ Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 The one-dimensional flux power spectrum (P1D) of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest probes small-scale structure in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is therefore sensitive to a variety of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. These include the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, the thermal history of the IGM, the sum of neutrino masses, and potential small-scale fluctuations due to the nature of dark matter. However, P1D is also highly sensitive to observational and instrumental systematics, making accurate synthetic spectra essential for validating analyses and quantifying these effects, especially in high-volume surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We present an efficient lognormal mock framework for generating one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectra tailored for P1D analysis. Our method captures the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted flux and the scale-dependent shape and amplitude of the one-dimensional flux power spectrum by tuning Gaussian field correlations and transformation parameters. Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \leq z \leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \leq k \leq 1.0$ s km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to sub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we discuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of astrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects. Such improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and enable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D inference and precision cosmology.
