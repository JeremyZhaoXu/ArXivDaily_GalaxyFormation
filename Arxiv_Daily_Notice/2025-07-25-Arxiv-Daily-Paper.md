 - **Abstract**
 A key result from JWST's first cycles is that galaxy formation was well underway by $z=10$. The implications of these early galaxies for reionization are less clear, however. The CMB is one of the few windows into the ionization state of the IGM during reionization's first half, providing an important probe of the ionizing photon sources at those times. Meanwhile, measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of high-$z$ quasars have improved to the level of tightly constraining the timing of reionization's end. In this paper, we use radiative transfer simulations to explore how measurements of the patchy kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pkSZ) effect, when combined with Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements, can be used to constrain the early stages of reionization and the nature of its sources. For a given source model, we find that the amplitude of the pkSZ power spectra strongly correlates with the start time of reionization, and constrains the number of ionizing photons produced by the high-$z$ source population. Allowing for variations in the source model, this correlation is weakened by a degeneracy between the reionization history and the effects of source clustering. However, we demonstrate two potential ways of breaking this degeneracy using: (1) measurements of large-scale fluctuations in the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity at $z=5-6$, and/or; (2) the shape of the pkSZ power spectrum measured in future CMB surveys. Models with highly clustered sources yield steeper slopes in the pkSZ power around $\ell = 3,000$, so measurements at additional angular scales can be used to break the history-clustering degeneracy. Our results highlight how future pkSZ measurements will complement JWST observations to improve our understanding of the ionizing sources near cosmic dawn.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulating black hole (BH) accretion and feedback from the horizon to galactic scales is extremely challenging, as it involves a vast range of scales. Recently, our multizone method has successfully achieved global dynamical steady-states of hot accretion flows in three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations by tracking the bidirectional interaction between a non-spinning BH and its host galaxy. In this paper, we present technical improvements to the method and apply it to spin $a_*=0.9$ BHs, which power relativistic jets. We first test the new multizone set-up with a smaller Bondi radius, $R_B\approx400\,r_g$, where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius. The strongly magnetized accretion launches a relativistic jet with an intermediate feedback efficiency $\eta\sim30\,\%$, in between that of a prograde ($\eta\sim100\,\%$) and retrograde ($\eta\sim 10\,\%$) torus. Interestingly, both prograde and retrograde simulations also eventually converge to the same intermediate efficiency when evolved long enough, as accumulated magnetic fields remove gas rotation. We then extend strongly magnetized simulations to larger Bondi radii, $R_B\approx 2\times10^3,~2\times 10^4,~2\times 10^5\,r_g$. We find that the BH accretion rate $\dot{M}$ is suppressed with respect to the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$ as $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_B\propto R_B^{-1/2}$. However, despite some variability, the time-averaged feedback efficiency is $\eta\sim30\,\%$, independent of $R_B$. This suggests that BH feedback efficiency in hot accretion flows is mainly governed by the BH spin ($a_*$) rather than by the galactic properties ($R_B$). From these first-principles simulations, we provide a feedback subgrid prescription for cosmological simulations: $\dot{E}_{\rm fb}=2\times10^{-3}[R_B/(2\times10^5\,r_g)]^{-1/2}\dot{M}_Bc^2$ for BH spin $a_*=0.9$.
#### Variational autoencoder for generating realistic $N$-body simulations for dark matter halos

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore the use of a variational autoencoder (VAE), a deep generative model, to compress and generate images of dark matter density fields from $\Lambda$CDM like cosmological simulations. The VAE learns a compact, low-dimensional representation of the large-scale structure, enabling both accurate reconstruction and generation of statistically realistic samples. We evaluated the generated images by comparing their power spectra to those of real simulations and the theoretical $\Lambda$CDM prediction, finding strong agreement with the state-of-the-art simulations. In addition, the VAE provides a fast and scalable method for generating synthetic cosmological data, making it a valuable tool for data augmentation. These capabilities can accelerate the development and training of more advanced machine learning models for cosmological analysis, particularly in scenarios where large-scale simulations are computationally expensive. Our results highlight the potential for generative artificial intelligence as a practical bridge between physical modeling and modern deep learning in cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper examines the reliability of the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method in measuring the pattern speed of barred galaxies at high redshifts. Measuring pattern speeds at high redshift may help to shed light on the time evolution of interactions between galactic bars and dark matter halos. The TW method has been extensively employed for nearby galaxies, and its accuracy in determining bar pattern speeds has been validated through numerical simulations. For nearby galaxies, the method yields acceptable results when the inclination angle of the galaxy and the position angle of the bar fall within appropriate ranges. However, the application of the TW method to high-redshift galaxies remains unexplored in both observations and simulations. In this study, we generate mock observations of barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. These simulated observations are tailored to mimic the Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopy data that the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) would capture at a redshift of $z\simeq 1.2$. By applying the TW method to these mock observations and comparing the results with the known pattern speeds, we demonstrate that the TW method performs adequately for barred galaxies with bars sufficiently long to be detected by JWST at high redshifts. This work opens a new avenue for applying the TW method to investigate the properties of high-redshift barred galaxies.
