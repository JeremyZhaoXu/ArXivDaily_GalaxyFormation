 - **Abstract**
 Stellar shells and streams are remnants of satellite galaxies visible around galaxies. Advances in low-surface-brightness observations and increasing resolution of cosmological simulations now allow investigating the properties and origin of these features. The metallicity, age, and velocity dispersion of shells and streams are investigated to infer their progenitor galaxies properties. We employed the hydrodynamical cosmological simulations Magneticum Pathfinder to extract these properties and identify the progenitors of the shells and streams. We compared to observational results from surveys and individual galaxies, matching and testing the methodology used in observations. Mock observations of shells and streams agree well with observational data regarding their morphology and spatial distribution. We find that both types of features are associated with localized depressions in stellar velocity dispersion compared to the surrounding regions. They are not as clearly distinct in metallicity and ages, though overall shells and more metal rich and streams are younger. We confirm results from idealized models that shells form commonly from radial major mergers but also through minor mergers, while streams usually form from minor mergers on circular orbits. We do not find the widths of streams to correlate with the half-mass radii of their progenitors, but the progenitors follow the mass-metallicity relation. On average, the masses measured for shells and streams approximately corresponds to 20% of the progenitor mass. We introduce a class of star-forming streams, which originate from in-situ star formation rather than the disruption of a satellite galaxy. Measuring stellar population properties of shells and streams provides the means to reconstruct the progenitor properties, and especially distinguish those streams that are not made through the disruption of a galaxy but formed in-situ.
#### MUSE study of two giant low surface brightness galaxies with compact satellites

 - **Abstract**
 Giant low-surface-brightness disk galaxies (gLSBGs) are rare objects with disk radii up-to 160 kpc and dynamical masses of an order of up to 10$^{12}$ $M_{\odot}$. Their very existence challenges currently accepted theories of galaxy formation and evolution, as it is difficult to build such large, dynamically cold disks through mergers without destroying them. We present deep MUSE mosaic observations of two nearby gLSBGs with compact elliptical satellites: UGC 1382, which hosts a globally counter-rotating gaseous disk, and AGC 192040, which does not. We analyze properties of ionized gas and present spatially resolved kinematics and metallicity maps; as well as stellar population analysis for the central regions of the galaxies. The radial gradients of gas-phase metallicities are flat for both galaxies. Our estimates of the effective oxygen yield suggest 'passive' gas in the outskirts of both stellar systems that is not involved in star formation. Our observational data indicate that both galaxies experienced mergers several Gyrs ago. However, the scenarios of formation of giant disks appear to be slightly different for these two systems. For AGC 192040 we propose the gas accretion from the filament followed by the intermediate-mass ratio merger with the companion on a prograde orbit. For UGC 1382 multiple gas-rich mergers with companions on retrograde orbits are preferred by the data.

 - **Abstract**
 A physical understanding of galaxy formation and evolution benefits from an understanding of the connections between galaxies, their host dark matter halos, and their environments. In particular, interactions with more-massive neighbors can leave lasting imprints on both galaxies and their hosts. Distinguishing between populations of galaxies with differing environments and interaction histories is therefore essential for isolating the role of environment in shaping galaxy properties. We present a novel neural-network based method, which takes advantage of observable measures of a galaxy and its environment to recover whether it (1) is a central or a satellite, (2) has experienced an interaction with a more massive neighbor, and (3) is currently orbiting or infalling onto such a neighbor. We find that projected distances to, redshift separations of, and relative stellar masses with respect to a galaxy's 25 nearest neighbors are sufficient to distinguish central from satellite halos in $> 90\%$ of cases, with projection effects accounting for most classification errors. Our method also achieves high accuracy in recovering interaction history and orbital status, though the network struggles to distinguish between splashback and infalling systems in some cases due to the lack of velocity information. With careful treatment of the uncertainties introduced by projection and other observational limitations, this method offers a new avenue for studying the role of environment in galaxy formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Shock fronts driven by active galactic nuclei in galaxy cluster cores represent a promising mechanism to heat the intracluster gas by converting kinetic energy into thermal energy through gas compression, thereby offsetting radiative cooling. Despite their potential importance, such shocks are challenging to detect, requiring deep X-ray exposures, and have only been identified in ten clusters. We present the first systematic detection and characterization of AGN-driven shocks in simulated clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxies. TNG-Cluster exhibits a rich variety of X-ray structures, including realistic populations of X-ray cavities, as well as shocks, produced by its AGN feedback model, without collimated, relativistic jets, nor cosmic rays. We produce mock Chandra observations with deep exposure times, for a sample of 100 clusters, mass-matched (M$_{500c}=1.2$ - $8.5 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) to the ten observed clusters with shocks. Using observational techniques, we identify shocks through surface brightness edges fitted with broken power laws and associated density and temperature jumps. We detect 50 shocks in 30 of the 100 clusters, with ~35% hosting multiple shocks. These shocks lie within a hundred kiloparsec of the central SMBH, are weak (Mach number < 2, median ~ 1.1), and are associated with cavities in about half of the cases. Both in observations and in TNG-Cluster, shocks tend to be located at larger radii than cavities, with median offsets of 46 and 27 kpc, respectively. The observationally inferred shock powers are comparable to the cluster cooling luminosities (10$^{44-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$), suggesting that shocks in the simulation are crucial heating mechanisms. Our results indicate that shocks play a role as important as cavities in balancing cooling in cluster cores, acting isotropically and up to larger distances.

 - **Abstract**
 The hot gas in the outskirts of galaxy cluster-sized halos, extending around and beyond the virial radius into nearby accretion regions, remains among one of the least explored baryon components of large-scale cosmic structure. We present a stacking analysis of 680 galaxy clusters located in the western Galactic hemisphere, using data from the first two years of the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. The stacked X-ray surface brightness profile reveals a statistically significant signal extending out to 2r200m (~4.5 Mpc). The best-fit surface brightness profile is well described by a combination of terms describing orbiting and infalling gas, with a transition occurring around r200m. At this radius, the best-fit gas density is 2.5e-5 cm^-3, corresponding to a baryon overdensity of 30. By integrating the gas density profile out to r200m, we infer a gas fraction of 90% of the universal baryon fraction with the assumption of a typical halo concentration, indicating the completeness of the baryon budget within large radii. Additionally, we examine the hot gas distribution in massive clusters in the IllustrisTNG simulations from the halo center to the accretion region. This analysis reveals differences in radial gas profiles depending on whether the direction probes voids or nearby cosmic filaments. Beyond r200m, the density profile along the filament direction exceeds that along the void direction. This pattern aligns with the observed transition radius between the one-halo and two-halo terms, suggesting that r200m is the approximate radius marking the location at which cosmic filaments connect to galaxy clusters. Meanwhile, the comparisons of the gas density profile and gas fraction profile between the observation and the IllustrisTNG simulation suggest that the feedback processes in the stacking sample are more efficient than the IllustrisTNG model in distributing gas to large radii.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids are key elements in our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe. They are crucial to constrain cosmological parameters, understand the structure formation and evolution of our Universe, and they could also be pristine laboratories for studying galaxy formation without all the hassle due to environmental effects. Thus, the ability to accurately and consistently identify voids, both in numerical simulations and in observations, becomes mandatory. We present Algorithm for Void Identification in coSMology (AVISM), a new void finder for analysing both cosmological simulation outputs and observational galaxy catalogues. In the first case, the code should handle raw particle or cell data, dark matter halos or synthetic galaxy catalogues. In the case of observational data, the code should be coupled with external tools providing with the required dynamical information to apply the algorithm. A set of numerical tests designed to assess the code's capabilities are carried out. AVISM's performance is also compared, both statistically and on a one-to-one basis, with the DIVE and ZOBOV state-of-the-art void finders using as input a dark matter halo catalogue from a large-volume cosmological simulation. An application to a galaxy survey is provided to demonstrate the code's ability to handle real data. We have designed a new void finder algorithm that combines geometrical and dynamical information to identify void regions plus a hierarchical merging process to reconstruct the whole 3D structure of the void. The outcome of this process is a void catalogue with complex boundaries without assuming a prior shape. This process can be repeated at different levels of resolution using finer grids, leading to a list of voids-in-voids and a proper description of void substructure.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how Milky Way-like environments influence the sizes and structural properties of low-mass galaxies by comparing satellites of Milky Way analogs from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey with two control samples: an environmentally agnostic population from the SAGA background (SAGAbg) sample and isolated galaxies from the SDSS NASA-Sloan Atlas. All sizes and structural parameters are measured uniformly using pysersic to ensure consistency across samples. We find the half-light sizes of SAGA satellites are systematically larger than those of isolated galaxies, with the magnitude of the offset ranging from 0.05 to 0.12 dex (10-24%) depending on the comparison sample and completeness cuts. This corresponds to physical size differences between 85-200 pc at 10^7.5 solar masses and 220-960 pc at 10^10 solar masses. This offset persists among star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environment can influence the structure of low-mass galaxies even before it impacts quenching. The intrinsic scatter in the size-mass relation is lower for SAGA satellites than isolated galaxies, and the Sérsic index distributions of satellites and isolated galaxies are similar. In comparison to star-forming satellites, quenched SAGA satellites have a slightly shallower size-mass relation and rounder morphologies at low-mass, suggesting that quenching is accompanied by structural transformation and that the processes responsible differ between low- and high-mass satellites. Our results show that environmental processes can imprint measurable structural differences on satellites in Milky Way-mass halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origin of stars within a galaxy - whether formed in-situ or accreted from other galaxies (ex-situ) - is key to constraining its evolution. Spatially resolving these components provides crucial insights into a galaxy's mass assembly history. We aim to predict the spatial distribution of ex-situ stellar mass fraction in MaNGA galaxies, and to identify distinct assembly histories based on the radial gradients of these predictions in the central regions. We employ a diffusion model trained on mock MaNGA analogs (MaNGIA), derived from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. The model learns to predict the posterior distribution of resolved ex-situ stellar mass fraction maps, conditioned on stellar mass density, velocity, and velocity dispersion gradient maps. After validating the model on an unseen test set from MaNGIA, we apply it to MaNGA galaxies to infer the spatially-resolved distribution of their ex-situ stellar mass fractions - i.e. the fraction of stellar mass in each spaxel originating from mergers. We identify four broad categories of ex-situ mass distributions: flat gradient, in-situ dominated; flat gradient, ex-situ dominated; positive gradient; and negative gradient. The vast majority of MaNGA galaxies fall in the first category - flat gradients with low ex-situ fractions - confirming that in-situ star formation is the main assembly driver for low- to intermediate-mass galaxies. At high stellar masses, the ex-situ maps are more diverse, highlighting the key role of mergers in building the most massive systems. Ex-situ mass distributions correlate with morphology, star-formation activity, stellar kinematics, and environment, indicating that accretion history is a primary factor shaping massive galaxies. Finally, by tracing their assembly histories in TNG50, we link each class to distinct merger scenarios, ranging from secular evolution to merger-dominated growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Kinematic studies of young stars and star clusters have increased our understanding of the process of star formation and evolution in the Milky Way. FU Orionis objects are a specific class of young stellar object notable for their extremely high disk-to-star accretion rates. We use parallax and proper motion information from the Gaia astrometric survey to study five known FU Ori stars towards the Cygnus clouds, in the distance range ~500-900 parsecs, and seek evidence of their kinematic association with proximal stellar groups or clusters. We develop multiple search criteria within the Gaia datasets to look for nearby stellar aggregates and to reliably isolate their likely member stars. We show that V1057 Cygni and HBC 722 are kinematically consistent with the 3D locations as well as the inferred proper motion fields of the North America Nebula cluster. We show a similar association of V1515 Cygni with NGC 6914 in the Cygnus-X region, and of V2494 Cygni with stars in the dark cloud LDN 1003 and Braid Nebula. Further, we find that V1735 Cygni is consistent in both position and proper motion with the streamer structure of IC 5146, and we trace the streamer's similar proper motions to the main cluster. Color-magnitude diagrams of all identified clusters show the presence of pre-main-sequence populations, strengthening the likelihood of a physical association between the young FU Ori stars and their respective nearby clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Although numerous dynamical techniques have been developed to estimate the total dark matter halo mass of the Milky Way, it remains poorly constrained, with typical systematic uncertainties of 0.3 dex. In this study, we apply a neural network-based approach that achieves high mass precision without several limitations that have affected past approaches; for example, we do not assume dynamical equilibrium, nor do we assume that neighboring galaxies are bound satellites. Additionally, this method works for a broad mass range, including for halos that differ significantly from the Milky Way. Our model relies solely on observable dynamical quantities, such as satellite orbits, distances to larger nearby halos, and the maximum circular velocity of the most massive satellite. In this paper, we measure the halo mass of the Milky Way to be $\log_{10} M_\mathrm{vir}/\Msun = 12.20^{+0.163}_{-0.138}$. Future studies in this series will extend this methodology to estimate the dark matter halo mass of M31, and develop new neural networks to infer additional halo properties including concentration, assembly history, and spin axis.
#### A fast powerful X-ray transient from tidal disruption of a white dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be tore apart by strong tidal force, producing electromagnetic flares. Some 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed, involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls onto the BH fueling the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs)-the most prevalent compact stars a million times denser and thus tougher than gaseous stars-can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of 10^2-10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are predicted to generate more powerful and short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report observations of a fast, luminous X-ray transient EP250702a. Its one-day-long peak showed strong recurrent flares extending to several tens of MeV in gamma-rays, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet X-rays dropped sharply from exceeding 3 x 10^49 to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days. These characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than a jetted-TDE evolving within a short timespan previously unseen-indicating the disruption of a white dwarf by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting extreme super-Eddington luminosity, possibly from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window to study elusive IMBHs and the otherwise invisible interior of degenerate stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are astrophysical phenomena arising when stars are disrupted by supermassive black holes. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), with its unprecedented depth and cadence, will detect thousands of TDEs, motivating the need for robust photometric classifiers capable of efficiently distinguishing these events from other extragalactic transients. We aim to develop and validate a machine learning pipeline for photometric TDE identification in LSST-scale datasets. Our classifier is designed to provide high precision and recall, enabling the construction of reliable TDE catalogs for multi-messenger follow-up and statistical studies. Using the second Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC2) dataset, we fit Gaussian Processes (GP) to light curves for feature extraction (e.g., color, rise/fade times, GP length scales). We then train and tune boosted decision-tree models (XGBoost) with a custom scoring function emphasizing high-precision recovery of TDEs. Our pipeline is tested on a diverse simulation of transient and variable events, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and superluminous supernovae. We achieve high precision (up to 95%) while maintaining competitive recall (about 72%) for TDEs, with minimal contamination from non-TDE classes. Key predictive features include post-peak colors and GP hyperparameters, reflecting characteristic timescales and spectral behaviors of TDEs. Our photometric classifier provides a practical and scalable approach to identifying TDEs in forthcoming LSST data. By capturing essential color and temporal properties through GP-based feature extraction, it enables efficient construction of clean TDE candidate samples.
#### Time-Dependent obscuration of a tidal disruption event candidate in the active galactic nucleus CSS100217

 - **Abstract**
 CSS100217 is considered a peculiar tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate occurring in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Unlike typical TDEs, where the post-flare luminosity is equal to that pre-flare, CSS100217 decayed to $\sim$ 0.4 magnitudes fainter than its pre-flare V band level. In this manuscript, we propose an obscured TDE model to explain the light curve of CSS100217. Assuming that the time-dependent obscuration, caused by the TDE unbound stellar debris, or by nuclear clouds moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH), follows a Weibull distribution, we find that the light curve of CSS100217 can be described by the tidal disruption of a $4.6_{-0.9}^{+0.9}{\rm M_\odot}$ main-sequence star by a $3.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$ black hole. The total energy of the event derived from our fit is $7.23\times10^{53}$ ergs and about 1.38 ${\rm M_\odot}$ of debris mass is accreted by the central SMBH. The model indicates that the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed pre-flare optical luminosity is not-significant compared to that of the AGN, which is consistent with the results of the spectral analysis. These results suggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual TDE-like variability observed in CSS100217.

 - **Abstract**
 The peak model of structure formation was built more than fifty years ago with the aim to address the origin of dark matter halo rotation in the tidal torque theory (TTT). Paradoxically, it has allowed one to explain and reproduce all halo properties found in cosmological simulations except their rotation, which remains to be understood. With the present two Papers we remedy this anomaly. In Paper I we derived the angular momentum (AM) of protohalos centered on triaxial peaks of suited scale, taking into account that, to leading order, their density profile is smooth and homogeneous. Here we use that result to derive the AM of these objects, accounting for the fact that their actual density profile is slightly outward decreasing and lumpy so that they do not collapse monolithically at once, but progressively from inside out, undergoing mergers during the process. By monitoring in detail their resulting mass and AM growth, we characterize the spin distribution of final halos and the precise mass and radial distribution of their inner mean specific AM. The results obtained explain and reproduce the rotational properties of simulated halos.
#### On the Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Transient GRB 250702B/EP250702

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 250702B/EP250702a is an interesting long-duration gamma-ray transient whose nature is in debate. To obtain a full picture in gamma-ray band, we implement a comprehensive targeted search of burst emission in a wide window of 30 days jointly with Insight-HXMT, GECAM and Fermi/GBM data within the ETJASMIN framework. In gamma-ray band, we find there is a 50-second precursor about 25 hours before the 4-hour main burst, which generally consists of 4 emission episodes. Remarkably, we find that the soft X-ray emission (after the main burst) decays as a power-law with start time aligning with the last episode of main emission and index of -5/3 perfectly consistent with the canonical prediction of fallback accretion. We conclude that the properties of precursor, main burst and the following soft X-ray emission strongly support the atypical collapsar Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Burst (ULGRB) scenario rather than the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE), and all these gamma-ray and soft X-ray emission probably originate from relativistic jet whose luminosity is dominated by the fallback accretion rate during the death collapse of a supergiant star.
#### Impact of Large-Scale Structure along Line-of-Sight on Time-Delay Cosmography

 - **Abstract**
 Time-delay cosmography, by monitoring the multiply imaged gravitational lenses in the time domain, offers a promising and independent method for measuring cosmological distances. However, in addition to the main deflector that produces the multiple images, the large-scale structure along the line-of-sight (LoS) will also deflect the traveling light rays, known as weak lensing (WL). Due to resolution limitations, accurately measuring WL on arcsecond scales is highly challenging. In this work, we evaluate the LoS effects on both lensing images and time-delay measurements using a more straightforward, high-resolution N-body simulation that provides a more realistic matter distribution compared to the traditional, computationally cheaper halo rendering method. We employ the multi-plane ray tracing technique, which is traditionally utilized to compute WL effects at the arcminute scale, extending its application to the strong lensing regime at the arcsecond scale. We focus on the quadruple-image system and present the following findings: 1. In addition to a constant external convergence, large-scale structures within a region approximately 2 arcminutes in angular size act as external perturbers, inducing inhomogeneous fluctuations on the arcsecond scale; 2. These fluctuations cannot be fully accounted for by external shear alone, necessitating the inclusion of external flexion; 3. While incorporating flexion provides a reasonably good fit to the lensing image, the time-delay distance still exhibits a $6.2$\textperthousand~bias and a $2.5\%$ uncertainty. This underscores the limitations of the single-plane approximation, as time-delay errors accumulate along the LoS.

 - **Abstract**
 The outer Galaxy is characterized by a lower metallicity than regions near the Sun, suggesting differences in the formation and survival of molecules in star-forming regions. To understand chemical evolution across the Milky Way, deriving molecular abundances in star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy is essential for refining models of sub-Solar metallicity environments. We analyzed IRAM 30m observations at 3 and 2 mm toward 35 sources at Galactocentric distances of 9$-$24 kpc, within the "CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy" (CHEMOUT) project. We focused on species with the highest detection rates (i.e., HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO, SO) and searched for trends in column densities, abundances, and line widths with Galactocentric distance. Abundances for H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH were updated using H$_2$ column densities from new NIKA2 dust maps. Fractional abundances relative to H$_2$ of most species (HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, HCO, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH) scale at most with the elemental carbon abundance ([C/H]) up to $\sim$24 kpc. SO shows a steeper gradient than sulfur abundance ([S/H]), while H$^{13}$CO$^+$ shows a shallower gradient than [$^{13}$C/H]. Gas turbulence, inferred from line widths, decreases with Galactocentric distance, suggesting a more quiescent environment in the outer Galaxy with respect to the inner Galaxy. In the outer Galaxy, the formation efficiency of most molecules, following the parent element availability, is comparable or higher (e.g., for H$^{13}$CO$^+$) than in the local Galaxy, whereas SO forms less efficiently. These results have significant implications for chemical models of the outermost star-forming regions and for understanding molecule formation under lower metallicity conditions.

 The Universe consists of a variety of objects that formed at different epochs, leading to variations in the formation time which represents the time elapsed from the onset of structure formation until the formation time of a particular object. In this work, we present two approaches to reconstruct and constrain the galaxy formation time $t_f(z)$ using non-parametric reconstruction methods, such as Gaussian Processes (GP) and High-performance Symbolic Regression (SR). Our analysis uses age estimates of 32 old passive galaxies and the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and considers two different values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ from the SH0ES and Planck Collaborations. When adopting the $\Lambda$CDM model and the GP reconstructions, we find $\left<t_f\right>=0.72_{-0.16}^{+0.14}$ Gyr (SH0ES) and $\left<t_f\right>=1.26_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$ Gyr (Planck). Without considering a specific cosmological model, we obtain $\left<t_f\right>=0.71 \pm {0.19}$ Gyr (SH0ES) and $\left<t_f\right> = 1.35_{-0.23}^{+0.21}$ Gyr (Planck). Similar values are obtained from the SR reconstructions, with both methods (GP and SR) indicating the same behavior regarding the time evolution of $t_f(z)$. The results also show significant differences in the formation time from SH0ES and Planck values, highlighting the impact of the $H_0$ tension on the cosmological estimates of $t_f(z)$. In particular, the different approaches used in the analysis agree with each other, demonstrating the robustness and consistency of our results. Overall, this study suggests that galaxies have different evolutionary timescales and that $t_f$ is not constant, with noticeable variations at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 0.5$).

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift (z > 2) massive quiescent (MQ) galaxies provide an opportunity to probe the key physical processes driving the fuelling and quenching of star formation in the early Universe. Observational evidence suggests a possible evolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or submillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However, galaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these populations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their formation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings. In previous work, we presented a re-calibrated version of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model that provides an improved match to observationally-inferred number densities of both DSFG and MQ populations. In this work, we use this new model to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z > 2 and the physical mechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z > 2 were sub-millimetre-bright ($S_{870}$ > 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past. The stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre flux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be independent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve into MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors lies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger that triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting their cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents further gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG population remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding primarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later.
