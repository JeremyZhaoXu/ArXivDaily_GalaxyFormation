 - **Abstract**
 The presence of massive black holes (BHs) exceeding $10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ already at redshift $z > 6$ challenges standard models of BH growth. Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at $z \sim 15$, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to $10^5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ within a few $10^3$-$10^4$ years, independent of seed properties. Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than $\sim$1 Myr due to local gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic times, even starting from light seeds.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation in galaxies is regulated by the interplay of a range of processes that shape the multiphase gas in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. Using the CAMELS suite of cosmological simulations, we study the effects of varying feedback and cosmology on the average star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies at $z\sim0$ across the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and ASTRID galaxy formation models. We find that galaxy SFHs in all three models are sensitive to changes in stellar feedback, which affects the efficiency of baryon cycling and the rates at which central black holes grow, while effects of varying AGN feedback depend on model-dependent implementations of black hole seeding, accretion and feedback. We also find strong interaction terms that couple stellar and AGN feedback, usually by regulating the amount of gas available for the central black hole to accrete. Using a double power-law to describe the average SFHs, we derive a general set of equations relating the shape of the SFHs to physical quantities like baryon fraction and black hole mass across all three models. We find that a single set of equations (albeit with different coefficients) can describe the SFHs across all three CAMELS models, with cosmology dominating the SFH at early times, followed by halo accretion, and feedback and baryon cycling at late times. Galaxy SFHs provide a novel, complementary probe to constrain cosmology and feedback, and can connect the observational constraints from current and upcoming galaxy surveys with the physical mechanisms responsible for regulating galaxy growth and quenching.
#### Evolution of galaxy attenuation curves driven by evolving dust mass and grain size distributions

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impacts of the evolution of dust mass and grain size distribution within a Milky Way-like (MW-like) galaxy simulation on global attenuation curves, focusing on the optical-UV slope and the 2175 $AA$ bump. We discuss the contributions of star-dust geometry, scattering, and dust properties. Post-processing dust radiative transfer was performed using SKIRT based on the MW-like galaxy simulation. The simulation was carried out with GADGET4-OSAKA, which models the evolution of grain size distributions. For lower inclination angles (closer to face-on), the attenuation curve flattens over time up to t=1 Gyr, then becomes progressively steeper. This steeper slope arises from the interplay between scattering and the dust disk becoming more extended over time (changes in star-dust geometry). At higher inclination, scattering is suppressed, and the attenuation curves slightly steepen over time due to small-grain formation and the bias of observed UV light toward older stars. The bump strengthens on a timescale of ~250 Myr due to the formation of small carbonaceous grains. The bump strength is affected not only by the abundance of small grains but also by star-dust geometry. At higher $A_V$ or higher inclination, the bump weakens. These results may help interpret flatter attenuation curves and weaker bumps in high-redshift galaxies. Variations in star-dust geometry alter the amount of scattered photons escaping the galaxy, driving the anti-correlation between the slope and $A_V$. Scatter in this relation arises from differences in dust optical depth along and perpendicular to the line of sight, reflecting inclination and star-dust geometry. Additional contributions come from variations in grain size distribution and the fraction of obscured young stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a new method for simulating stellar streams generated by globular clusters using angle-action coordinates. This method reproduces the variable mass-loss and variable frequency of the stripped stars caused by the changing tidal forces acting on the cluster as it moves along an eccentric orbit. The model incorporates realistic distributions for the stripping angle and frequency of the stream stars both along and perpendicular to the stream. The stream is simulated by generating random samples of stripped stars and integrating them forward in time in angle-frequency space. Once the free parameters are calibrated, this method can be used to simulate the internal structure of stellar streams more quickly than N-body simulations, while achieving a similar level of accuracy. We use this model to study the surface density of the stellar stream produced by the globular cluster M68 (NGC 4590). We select $291$ stars from the Gaia-DR3 catalogue along the observable section that are likely to be members of the stream. We find that the width of the stream is too large to be explained by stars stripped from the cluster alone. We simulate the stream using the present method and include the Gaia selection function and observational errors, and the process of separating the stream stars from the foreground. By comparing these results with the observed data, we estimate the age of the stream, or equivalently the cluster accretion time, to be $3.04_{-0.29}^{+5.63}$ Gyr, and the mass-loss of the cluster to be $0.496 \pm 0.030$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ arm$^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Current galaxy formation models predict the existence of X-ray-emitting gaseous halos around Milky Way (MW)-type galaxies. To investigate properties of this coronal gas in MW-like galaxies, we analyze a suite of high-resolution simulations based on the {\it SMUGGLE} framework, and compare the results with X-ray observations of both the MW and external galaxies. We find that for subgrid models incorporating any form of stellar feedback, e.g., early feedback (including stellar winds and radiation) and/or supernova (SN) explosions, the total $0.5-2$\,keV luminosity is consistent {\it within uncertainties} with X-ray observations of the MW and with scaling relations derived for external disk galaxies. However, all models exhibit an X-ray surface brightness profile that declines too steeply beyond $\sim5$\,kpc, underpredicting the extended emission seen in recent eROSITA stacking results. Across all subgrid prescriptions, the simulated surface brightness and emission measure fall below MW observations by at least $1-2$ orders of magnitude, with the most severe discrepancy occurring in the no-feedback model. Our results suggest that (i) stellar feedback primarily shapes the innermost hot atmosphere (central $\sim5$\,kpc), with comparable contributions from early feedback and SNe to the resulting X-ray luminosity; (ii) additional mechanisms such as gravitational heating, AGN feedback, and/or Compton effects of GeV cosmic ray are necessary to generate the extended, volume-filling hot gaseous halo of MW-mass galaxies; (iii) the origins of hot corona in MW-like galaxies are partially distinct from those of the warm ($\sim10^5$\,K) gas, by combining our previous finding that the {\it SMUGGLE} model successfully reproduces the kinematics and spatial distribution of MW \ion{O}{6} absorbers \citep{2024ApJ...962...15Z}.
#### Gaia's promise to detect compact-object binaries: where we stand with the third data release

 - **Abstract**
 With its third data release (DR3), Gaia begins unveiling dormant candidate compact object (CO) binaries with luminous companion (LC) as predicted by several past theoretical studies. To date, 3 black hole (BH), 21 neutron star (NS), and ~3200 white dwarf (WD) candidates have been identified with LCs in detached orbits using astrometry. We adopt an observationally motivated sampling scheme for the star formation history of the Milky Way, and initial zero-age main-sequence binary properties, incorporate all relevant binary interaction processes during evolution to obtain a realistic present-day intrinsic population of CO--LC binaries. We apply Gaia's selection criteria to identify the CO--LC binaries detectable using the observational cuts applicable for DR3 as well as its end-of-mission (EOM). We find that under the DR3 selection cuts, our detectable population includes no BH--LCs, approximately 10-40 NS--LCs, and around ~4300 WD--LCs. In contrast, by EOM, the expected numbers increase to 30-300 BH--LCs, 1500-5000 NS--LCs, and ~10^5-10^6 WD--LC binaries, primarily because of the significantly longer baseline of observation.
