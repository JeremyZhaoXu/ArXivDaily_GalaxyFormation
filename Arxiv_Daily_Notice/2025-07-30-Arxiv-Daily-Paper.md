 - **Abstract**
 The globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5) is in the process of being tidally shredded as it orbits the Milky Way. Its core is currently at a heliocentric distance of ~21 kpc, near apogalacticon (~18 kpc), and it reaches ~5-7 kpc at perigalacticon. Pal 5's leading and trailing arms stretch over 20 degrees on the sky, making them sensitive probes of the Milky Way's mass distribution. In this work, we search for red giant members of Pal 5 using spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17 and photometric and astrometric data from Gaia DR3. Based on position and proper motion, we identify eight members of Pal 5: six in the core and two in the stream. The clustering algorithm HDBSCAN finds these same eight. We then use chemical tagging with APOGEE abundances to search for additional members across five APOGEE fields overlapping Pal 5. While several dozen candidates are identified, most deviate (some significantly) from known kinematic and color-magnitude trends, suggesting that they are less likely to be true members. We estimate the expected number of giants in the APOGEE pointings based on the area and stellar mass of the streams. Given APOGEE's limiting magnitude, we find that few, if any, new giants are expected, especially if the stream is more diffuse at these locations. Our results support the presence of density variations in Pal 5's tidal streams, consistent with earlier studies attributing such features to baryonic perturbers in the Milky Way, dark matter subhaloes, or interactions with passing globular clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Romulus25 cosmological simulation volume to study a large sample of late-type gas-rich galaxies with low central surface brightnesses known as classical low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies and compare them to a mass-matched sample of high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies. We find that classical LSB galaxies make up a substantial fraction of the galaxy population, accounting for ~60% of all central galaxies with 8$\leq$log$_\mathrm{10}$(M$_\star$/M$_\odot$)$\leq$10. In Romulus25, classical LSB galaxies are predominantly formed through major mergers in which the secondary galaxy is co-rotating and aligned with the primary galaxy's gas disk and/or has above average orbital angular momentum at infall. The merger product is a high spin galaxy in which star formation is spread out and inefficient, allowing the galaxy to build up a large supply of relatively unenriched gas. The star formation rates of LSB galaxies are nearly constant over time, leading to stellar populations that are, on average, slightly older and therefore optically redder than those of similar HSB galaxies. However, because LSB galaxies are diffuse and metal-poor, they have very little internal reddening, causing them to appear bluer than HSB galaxies. We also find that, when compared to the bulges of HSB galaxies, the bulges of LSB galaxies are similar in mass, but are lower surface brightness, redder, and more diffuse on average. Despite these differences, classical LSB galaxies are part of the continuum of the galaxy population in Romulus25, constituting one of many evolutionary paths.
#### Feasibility of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray backtracking through sparse local measurements of the Galactic magnetic field

 - **Abstract**
 Planned and ongoing campaigns for the acquisition of high-quality local measurements of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) at interstellar cloud locations have generated intense interest in the use of such measurements to accurately backtrack Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) through the Milky Way, a crucial aspect of charged-particle astronomy. However, the inherent sparsity of these measurements raises concerns regarding the feasibility of this approach. We assessed the achievable accuracy of UHECR backtracking using mock sparse local GMF data derived from the Jansson & Farrar 2012 (JF12) GMF model and mock UHECR events. We created mock UHECR datasets that trace back within a 3 degree angular range from the galaxy M82 (a hypothesized UHECR source), and we investigated the impact on such backtracking attempts of varying GMF measurement sparsity and of varying GMF strength, which we emulated by rescaling the strength of the ordered components of the JF12 model. We found that: (a) for an average GMF strength of $1\mu G$, satisfactory backtracking results for magnetic rigidities of $10^{20}$ eV can be obtained even with very sparse measurements ($ \sim 1600$ pc); (b) when the average GMF strength is significantly increased ($\sim$ factor of 10) the accuracy of backtracking breaks down at measurement spacings of 400 pc. These findings emphasize on one hand that sparsity is not an automatic deal-breaker for the utility of local GMF measurements in UHECR backtracking. On the other hand, we also confirm that important challenges remain on the path from sparse local GMF measurements to precise charge-particle astronomy, especially in directions of high-strength ordered magnetic fields. This underscores the importance of using all available complementary magnetic field measurements and sophisticated reconstruction techniques to enable accurate backtracking of UHECR.
#### A North-South Metallicity Asymmetry in the Outer Galactic disk -- Evidence for the Pericentric Passage of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present maps of the mean metallicity distributions on the Galactocentric $R$--$Z$ plane at different azimuthal angles using red clump stars selected from the LAMOST and APOGEE surveys. In the inner disk ($R < $ 11\,kpc), the metallicity distribution is symmetric between the upper and lower disk. However, we find a North-South metallicity asymmetry in the outer disk ($R > 11$\,kpc), especially towards the anti-Galactic center ($-5^\circ < \Phi < 15^\circ$) direction. By further dissecting the map in age space, we detect this asymmetry across all mono-age stellar populations. However, the asymmetry is less pronounced in older populations ($\tau > 8$ Gyr) compared to younger ones ($\tau < 6$\,Gyr). This reduced significance likely stems from three factors: larger age uncertainties, fewer stars in the outer disk, and the kinematically hotter nature of older populations. The observed metallicity asymmetry may be the consequence of the purturbation of the recent pericentric passage through the Galactic disk and tidal force of the well-known Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
#### A multi-frequency, multi-epoch radio continuum study of the Quintuplet cluster with the Very Large Array

 - **Abstract**
 The Quintuplet cluster, located in the Galactic centre, is one of the few young massive clusters in the Milky Way. It allows us to study dozens of massive, post main sequence stars individually, providing unique insights into the properties of the most massive stars. Our goal is to study the radio continuum emission of the most massive stars in the cluster. We carried out a total of nine observations (three in the C- and six in the X-band) of the Quintuplet cluster with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in A-configuration. We cross-matched the detected sources with infrared stellar catalogues to ensure cluster membership, calculated their spectral indices, quantified variability, and inferred clumping-scaled mass-loss rates We present the most complete catalogue of radio stars in the Quintuplet cluster to date, with a total of 41 detections, and the deepest images of the cluster in the 4 to 12 GHz range (reaching an rms noise level of $2.3\, \mu\mathrm{Jy/beam}$ in the X-band). The six year baseline of our observations allowed us to perform a robust variability assessment, finding that around $60\%$ of the Quintuplet radio-stars are variable on timescales of months to years. We derived the spectral indices of 28 out of the 41 sources. Based on their spectral indices and variability, we classify 11 of them as colliding-wind binaries, seven as strictly thermal sources, and ten as ambiguous. Including the ambiguous sources, we estimate a multiplicity fraction of ($75\pm22\%$). We also computed upper limits for the mass-loss rates of the thermal radio-stars, finding them in agreement with typical values for WNh and WC stars. Finally, we compare these results to the ones obtained from our analogous study of the Arches cluster.
#### Radio Variability in Recently-Quenched Galaxies: The Impact of TDE or AGN Driven Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows and jets launched from the nuclei of galaxies emit radio synchrotron emission that can be used to study the impact of accretion energy on the host galaxy. The decades-long baseline now enabled by large radio surveys allows us to identify cases where new outflows or jets have been launched. Here, we present the results of a targeted VLA program observing four post-starburst galaxies that have brightened significantly in radio emission over the past ~20 years. We obtain quasi-simultaneous observations in five bands (1-18 GHz) for each source. We find peaked spectral energy distributions, indicative of self-absorbed synchrotron emission. While all four sources have risen significantly over the past ~20 years in the 1-2 GHz band, two also show clear recent flares in the 2-4 GHz band. These sources are less luminous than typical peaked spectrum radio AGN. It remains unclear whether these sources are low luminosity analogs of the peaked radio AGN from accreted gas, or driven by tidal disruption events with missed optical flares. Regardless of the source of the accreted material, these newly-launched outflows contain sufficient energy to drive the molecular gas outflows observed in post-starburst galaxies and to drive turbulence suppressing star formation.
