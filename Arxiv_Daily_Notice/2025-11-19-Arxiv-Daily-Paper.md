#### Steady-State or Not? The Evolution of Cosmic Ray Electron Spectra in Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic ray (CR) electrons are key tracers of non-thermal processes in galaxies, yet their spectra are often modelled under the untested assumption of steady state between injection and cooling. In this work, we present a time-dependent modelling of CR electron spectra in a galactic context using the CREST code, applied to magnetohydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-mass galaxy performed with AREPO. CR electrons are injected at supernova sites and evolved with adiabatic changes and cooling processes on Lagrangian tracer particles, including losses from synchrotron, inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung, and Coulomb interactions. We compare these fully time-dependent spectra to local and global steady-state models computed with CRAYON+, as well as to one-zone analytic steady-state solutions. We find that the global CR electron spectrum in the simulated galactic disk closely resembles a steady-state solution up to energies of 500 GeV, with deviations only at higher energies where cooling times become shorter than injection timescales. High-energy electrons are dominated by recently injected populations that have not yet reached equilibrium, however, producing a steeper spectrum and lower normalisation than a steady-state model predicts. Spatially, the electrons modelled on-the-fly with CREST are more confined to the star-forming disk, in contrast to the more extended distributions from steady-state post-processing models. Our results demonstrate that while steady-state assumptions capture the bulk CR electron population in star-forming disks, a time-dependent treatment is essential to describe the high-energy and outflowing components.
#### Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in Nuclear Star Clusters: A Combined Dynamical-Secular Channel for GW231123-like Events

 - **Abstract**
 The recent binary black hole (BH) merger GW231123, with both components likely in the high-mass gap and with high spins, challenges standard BH binary formation models. It is usually thought that the BHs are of second (or higher) generation (2G), resulting from the mergers of smaller BHs. But the physical processes that produce the merging 2G BH binaries are unclear and highly unconstrained. We show that such 2G mergers can be naturally produced in the nuclear star cluster of Milky Way-like galaxy. The dominant channel combines a sequence of binary-single interactions with secular evolution driven by the central supermassive BH. Our model produces a merger rate consistent with GW231123 and further predicts an abundant population of 2G BH-star (or low-mass BH) binaries; these binaries may observationally manifest as micro tidal disruption events or low-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) sources. Detecting these binaries would provide crucial insights into the dynamical pathways of hierarchical BH assembly.
#### Robust galaxy image decompositions with Differential Evolution optimisation and the problem of classical bulges in and beyond the nearby Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Deconstructing galaxies through two-dimensional decompositions has been shown to be a powerful technique to derive the physical properties of stellar structures in galaxies. However, most studies employ fitting algorithms that are prone to be trapped in local minima, or involve subjective choices. Furthermore, when applied on samples beyond the nearby Universe, results on the fraction of classical bulges in disc galaxies do not agree with studies on nearby galaxies. The latter studies point to a small fraction of classical bulges, possibly challenging our merger-driven picture of galaxy formation. Therefore, understanding the discrepancy between observations in and beyond the nearby Universe is of paramount importance. In this paper, I use a sample of 16 nearby galaxies drawn from the TIMER project, which previously have been shown to not host classical bulges, and perform decompositions applying different methodologies and employing the original images as well as artificially redshifted images. I show that the Differential Evolution algorithm is able to provide accurate measurements of structural properties with little subjective intervention, correctly indicating the presence of nuclear discs (not classical bulges). However, I also show that when the physical spatial resolution is not adequate, a systematic overestimation of the photometric bulge Sérsic index leads to the false conclusion of the presence of classical bulges. I discuss how this may be the root cause of the discrepancy mentioned above, and point out how this issue may be a problem even with data from facilities such as Euclid, HST and JWST.
#### Aletheia: Emulating the non-linear matter power spectrum in the context of evolution mapping

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13826

 - **Abstract**
 We present Aletheia, a new emulator of the non-linear matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, built upon the evolution mapping framework. This framework addresses the limitations of traditional emulation by focusing on $h$-independent cosmological parameters, which can be separated into those defining the linear power spectrum shape ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{s}}$) and those affecting only its amplitude evolution ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{e}}$). The combined impact of evolution parameters and redshift is compressed into a single amplitude parameter, $\sigma_{12}$. Aletheia uses a two-stage Gaussian Process emulation: a primary emulator predicts the non-linear boost factor as a function of ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{s}}$) and $\sigma_{12}$ for fixed evolution parameters, while a second one applies a small linear correction based on the integrated growth history. The emulator is trained on shape parameters spanning $\pm$5$\sigma$ of Planck constraints and a wide clustering range $0.2 < \sigma_{12} < 1.0$, providing predictions for $0.006\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} < k < 2\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We validate Aletheia against N-body simulations, demonstrating sub-percent accuracy. When tested on a suite of dynamic dark energy models, the full emulator's predictions show a variance of approximately 0.2%, a factor of five smaller than that of the state-of-the-art EuclidEmulator2 (around 1% variance). Furthermore, Aletheia maintains sub-percent accuracy for the best-fit dynamic dark energy cosmology from recent DESI data, a model whose parameters lie outside the training ranges of most conventional emulators. This demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping approach, providing a robust and extensible tool for precision cosmology.
#### The observed total star formation rate function up to z \sim 6: complementary UV and IR contributions and comparison with state-of-the-art galaxy formation models

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the obscured IR-derived and the dust-corrected UV star formation rate functions (SFRFs) compare with each other, and with predictions from state-of-the-art theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. We derive the IR-SFRF from the ALMA A$^3$COSMOS survey, by converting the IR luminosity functions (IR-LFs) into SFRF after correcting for AGN contribution. Similarly, we obtain the UV SFRFs from literature UV LFs, corrected for dust-extinction. First, we fit the two SFRFs independently via a MCMC approach, then we combine them to obtain the first estimate of the total SFRF out to $z \sim 6$. Finally, we compare this SFRF with the predictions of a set of theoretical models. We derived the UV (dust-extinction corrected, from literature UV-LFs) and IR SFRFs (from Herschel and ALMA IR-LFs) at $0.5 < z < 6$ , finding that they are mostly complementary, covering different ranges in star formation rate (SFR$ < 10-100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the UV-corrected and SFR$ > 100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the IR). From the comparison of the total SFRF with model predictions we find an overall good agreement at $z < 2.5$, with increasing difference at higher redshifts, with all models missing the galaxies that are forming stars with the highest SFRs. We finally obtained the UV (dust-corrected), IR and total star formation rate densities (SFRDs), finding that there are no redshift ranges where UV and IR alone are able to reproduce the whole total SFRD.
#### Delayed radio emission in tidal disruption events from collisions of outflows driven by disk instabilities

 - **Abstract**
 Delayed radio emission has been associated with a growing proportion of tidal disruption events (TDEs). For many events, the radio synchrotron emission is inferred to originate from the interaction of mildly-relativistic outflows, launched with delay times of $\sim 100$--$1000$ d after the TDE optical peak. The mechanism behind these outflows remains uncertain, but may relate to instabilities or state transitions in the accretion disk formed from the TDE. We model the radio emission powered by the collision of mass outflows ("flares") from TDE accretion disks, considering scenarios in which two successive disk flares collide with each other, as well as collisions between the outflow and the circumnuclear medium (CNM). For flare masses of $\sim 0.01$-$0.1 M_{\odot}$, varied CNM densities, and different time intervals between ejected flares, we demonstrate that the shocks formed by the collisions have velocities $0.05c$-$0.3c$ at $\sim 10^{17}$ cm and power bright radio emission of $L_{\nu} \sim 10^{27}$-$10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, consistent with the properties inferred for observed events. We quantify how the typical peak timescale and flux varies for different properties of our models, and compare our model predictions to a selection of TDEs with delayed radio emission. Our models successfully reproduce the light curves and SEDs for several events, supporting the idea that delayed outflows from disk instabilities and state transitions can power late-time radio emission in TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Growing evidence shows that most stars in the Milky Way, including the Sun, are born in high-mass star-forming regions, but due to both observational and theoretical challenges, our understanding of their chemical evolution is much less clear than that of their low-mass counterparts. Thanks to the capabilities of new generation telescopes and computers, a growing amount of observational and theoretical results have been recently obtained, which have important implications not only for our understanding of the (still mysterious) formation process of high-mass stars, but also for the chemistry that the primordial Solar System might have inherited from its birth environment. In this review, we summarise the main observational and theoretical results achieved in the last decades in the study of chemistry evolution in high-mass star-forming regions, and in the identification of chemical evolutionary indicators. Emphasis is especially given to observational studies, for which most of the work has been carried out so far. A comparison with the chemical evolution occurring in other astrophysical environments, in particular in low-mass star-forming cores and extragalactic cores, is also briefly presented. Current open questions and future perspectives are discussed.
#### Hubble Space Telescope proper motions of Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters -- II. Kinematic structure of young and intermediate-age clusters

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore the kinematic properties of a sample of 19 young (<1 Gyr) and intermediate-age (1-2.5 Gyr) massive star clusters within the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We analyse the proper motions of the clusters, which have been measured based on multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. Additionally, we infer from the HST data homogeneous and robust estimates for the distances, ages and metallicities of the clusters. This collection of information, in combination with literature line-of-sight velocities, allows us to investigate the full 3D dynamics of our sample of clusters within the frame of the LMC in a self-consistent way. While most young clusters orbit the LMC close to the stellar disc plane, NGC 1850 (~100 Myr old) depicts a peculiar case. Depending on the exact distance from the disc, it follows either a highly inclined, retrograde orbit or an eccentric orbit along the bar structure. The orbits of young clusters that formed North of the LMC centre show signs that might be connected to the resettling motion of the LMC bar structure. Based on the dynamic properties in combination with the positions of the clusters in the age-metallicity space, we find no clear-cut evidence for clusters in our sample that could have been stripped from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) onto the LMC. We finally compare the kinematics of the intermediate-age clusters with a suite of simple numerical simulations of the Magellanic system to interpret the cluster motions. A possible interaction history of the LMC with the SMC, where the SMC had two past crossings of the LMC disc plane (about 300 and 900 Myr ago), in combination with the recent SMC pericentre passage, can qualitatively explain the observed kinematic structure of the clusters analysed in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a strongly lensed galaxy at $z\sim11-12$, dubbed the ``Misty Moons'', identified in the JWST Treasury Survey, Vast Exploration for Nascent, Unexplored Sources (VENUS). The Misty Moons is gravitationally lensed by the galaxy cluster MACS J0257.1-2325 at $z=0.505$, and has five multiple images suggested by two independent lensing models. Two of the five images, ID1 and ID2 ($\mu\sim 20-30$), are very bright (F200W$\sim26$ AB mag) and exhibit blue SEDs with prominent Ly$\alpha$ breaks. In the source plane, the Misty Moons is a sub-$L^*$ galaxy ($M_{\rm UV}\sim-18.0$ mag) resolved into multiple stellar clumps, each of which has effective radius of $r_\mathrm{eff}\sim 10-70$ pc and stellar mass of $\sim10^7\ M_\odot$. These clumps dominate the stellar mass budget of the Misty Moons ($\gtrsim80\%$), similar to other high-$z$ clumps, which suggests a highly clustered mode of star formation in the early Universe, unlike seen in local dwarf galaxies. We convolve the source-plane image with the JWST/NIRCam point-spread function to produce a mock NIRCam image of the Misty Moons without lensing magnification, and find that the intrinsic galaxy has a radial surface-brightness profile comparable to those of $z\gtrsim10$ faint galaxies, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, indicating that the Misty Moons represents a typical $z\gtrsim10$ faint galaxy. The Misty Moons, a lensed galaxy with resolved internal structures, provides an ideal laboratory for exploring the early stages of galaxy formation at $z\gtrsim10$.
#### The Eddington Ratio Distribution of Narrow Line Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the Eddington ratio distribution of local optical narrow line active galactic nuclei (AGN) as a function of host galaxy properties, as a potential test of supermassive black hole growth and feedback models in galaxy formation theory. We base our sample on integral field spectroscopy from the MaNGA data in SDSS-IV's DR17. Starting with MaNGA's calibrated row-stacked spectra, we produce new spectroscopic data cubes with minimal covariance between spaxels and higher resolution point spread functions (PSF), and then extract line fluxes for the central PSF. Using the line ratio diagnostic techniques of Ji & Yan (2020), we identify AGN galaxies and determine their H$\beta$ and [O III] line luminosities. For all galaxies not identified as AGN, we determine the threshold line luminosity they would have needed to be identified as AGN. These luminosity thresholds are essential to determine, because many star forming galaxies likely host AGN of significant luminosity that are unidentified because they are outshone by star formation related emission. We show that ignoring these selection effects when measuring the Eddington ratio distribution would lead to biased results. From the H$\beta$ luminosities and luminosity detection thresholds, accounting for selection effects, we measure the luminosity and Eddington ratio distributions of Seyferts as a function of specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass. Defining $F_{\rm AGN}$ as the occurrence rate of AGN above a fixed Eddington ratio of $10^{-3}$, we find that $F_{\rm AGN}$ is constant or increasing with stellar mass for star forming galaxies and declines strongly with stellar mass for quiescent galaxies. At stellar masses $\log_{10} M_\ast > 10.25$, the occurrence rate increases monotonically with sSFR. These patterns reveal a complicated dependence of AGN activity on galaxy properties for theoretical models to explain.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution mapping of cosmic mass distribution is essential for a variety of astrophysical applications including understanding cosmic structure formation, and galaxy formation and evolution. However dark matter is not directly observed and therefore we need advanced methods for solving inverse problems to reconstruct the underlying cosmic matter distribution. Here, we train a generative diffusion model and use it in the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) framework to reconstruct mass maps from Dark Energy Survey-Year 3 (DES-Y3) weak gravitational lensing data at high (1 arcminute) resolution. We show that the standard DPS results are biased, but they can be easily corrected by scaling the log-likelihood score during the diffusion process, yielding unbiased results with proper uncertainty quantification. The resulting mass maps reveal cosmic structures with enhanced detail, opening the door for improved astrophysical studies using the obtained mass maps.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) is a common prediction of a wide class of inflationary models. Equilateral-type PNG, generically predicted by single-field inflationary models with higher-derivative interactions, imprints subtle but measurable signatures on the large-scale distribution of matter. An important parameter of these imprints is the PNG-induced bias coefficient $b_\psi$, which quantifies how the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos and galaxies respond to mode coupling in the initial conditions. Measuring $b_\psi$ is important for constraining equilateral PNG, yet it is notoriously challenging due to its degeneracy with Gaussian scale-dependent bias contributions. In this work, we present the first precision measurements of equilateral $b_\psi$ for dark matter halos using effective field theory at the field level. We show that this approach disentangles PNG effects from those of the Gaussian bias by virtue of noise variance cancellation. We compare our results with the phenomenological predictions based on the Peak-Background Split model, finding some agreement at the qualitative level on the redshift and mass dependence, but poor agreement at the quantitative level. We present a fitting formula for $b_\psi$ as a function of the linear bias, which can be used to set priors in PNG searches with ongoing and future galaxy surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Unstructured Voronoi mesh simulations offer many advantages for simulating self-gravitating gas dynamics on galactic scales. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) can be a powerful tool for simulating the details of star cluster formation and gas dispersal by stellar feedback. Zooming in from galactic to local scales using the star cluster formation simulation package Torch requires transferring simulation data from one scale to the other. Therefore, we introduce VorAMR, a novel computational tool that interpolates data from an unstructured Voronoi mesh to an AMR Cartesian grid. VorAMR is integrated into the Torch package, which integrates the FLASH AMR magnetohydrodynamics code into the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment. VorAMR interpolates data from an AREPO simulation to a FLASH AMR grid using a nearest-neighbor particle scheme, which can then be evolved within the Torch package, representing the first ever transfer of data from a Voronoi mesh to an AMR Cartesian grid. Interpolation from one numerical representation to another results in an error of a few percent in global mass and energy conservation, which could be reduced with higher-order interpolation of the Voronoi cells. We show that the postinterpolation Torch simulation evolves without numerical abnormalities. A preliminary Torch simulation is evolved for 3.22 Myr and compared to the original AREPO simulation over the same time period. We observe similarly distributed star cluster formation between the two simulations. More compact clusters are produced in the Torch simulation as well as 2.3 times as much stellar material as in AREPO, likely due to the differences in resolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters provides a powerful probe of the spatial distribution of dark matter and its microphysical properties. Strong and weak lensing constraints on the density profiles of subhalos and their truncation radii offer key diagnostics for distinguishing between collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Notably, in the strongly collisional SIDM regime, subhalo core collapse and enhanced mass loss from ram-pressure stripping predict steeper central density slopes and more compact truncation radii--features that are directly testable with current lensing data. We analyze subhalo truncation in eight lensing clusters (Abell 2218, 383, 963, 209, 2390, and MACS J0416.1, J1206.2, J1149.6) that span the redshift range <$z_\text{spec}$>$ \simeq 0.17$-$0.54$ with virial masses $M_{200} \simeq0.41$-$2.2\times 10^{15}$ M$_\odot$ to constrain SIDM versus CDM. Our results indicate that the outer spatial extents of subhalos are statistically consistent with CDM, corroborated by redshift- and mass-matched analogs from the Illustris-TNG simulations. We conclude that the tidal radii of cluster galaxy subhalos serve as an important and complementary diagnostic of the nature of dark matter in these violent, dense environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) from massive black hole (MBH) mergers will provide a novel way to probe the high-redshift universe and are key to understanding galactic dynamics and evolution. In this work, we analyze MBH mergers, their GW signals and detectability, as well as their population properties, using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation - NINJA Simulation Suite. We discuss the effect of resolution and finite volume on the black hole mass function (BHMF), which in turn limits the mergers associated with low mass black holes, $M_{BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5} M_\odot$. We find the upper limit on the total mass of the MBH binaries detectable by LISA to be $\sim 10^{8.4} M_\odot$. We also find that adding time delays pertaining to dissipative processes like dynamical friction and stellar hardening during the final stages of the inspiral for which the simulation lacks sufficient resolution to model, considerably shifts the peak of redshift distribution of detectable binaries from $z\sim0.5$ to $z\sim0.1$. Time delays reduce the number of detectable GW events but on the other hand their signal-to-noise is increased. From the observational point of view, we find a strong correlation between the SFR and $L_{\rm bol}$ at high redshifts for the detectable LISA binaries. This may prove to be a future application in the coincident observation of MBH binaries by GW and electromagnetic observations.
