#### Shock Acceleration in the Intracluster Medium: Implications of Micromirror Confinement

 - **Abstract**
 Merging galaxy clusters exhibit strong observational evidence for efficient particle acceleration in the intracluster medium (ICM), particularly in the form of synchrotron-emitting radio relics and halos. Cosmic ray (CR) electrons are likely accelerated (or re-accelerated) at merger and accretion shocks via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). However, in the presence of the large diffusion coefficients one would naively expect in the rarefied, relatively unmagnetized ICM, this acceleration--in particular, the maximum proton energy ($E_{\rm max}$)--is limited by long acceleration times. On the other hand, recent work on CR transport suggests that the diffusion coefficient can be suppressed in ICM-like environments. In this picture, deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium can trigger the mirror instability, creating plasma-scale magnetic structures, or "micromirrors," that efficiently scatter CRs. In this paper, we investigate the implications of micromirror confinement for shock acceleration in the ICM. We demonstrate that micromirrors enforce a minimum value of $E_{\rm max} \gtrsim 100$ GeV that does not rely on CR-driven magnetic field amplification. We also discuss micromirror confinement in the context of cosmological simulations and $\gamma$-ray observations, and present a simulation of a Coma-like merging cluster that self-consistently includes CR acceleration at shocks, with an effective diffusion coefficient set by micromirrors. We show that the introduction of micromirrors yields simulated galaxy clusters that remain consistent with $\gamma$-ray observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO of Tidal Disruption Encores (TDEEs) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). TDEEs arise when a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) disrupts a star within the NSC, producing debris that is unbound from the sBH but remains gravitationally bound to the central massive black hole (MBH), leading to a delayed secondary flare. We find that the morphology and thermodynamics of the fallback material depend sensitively on the disruption geometry, MBH mass, and sBH-MBH separation. We identify two distinct morphological outcomes: ring encores, where debris circularize into a torus, and direct encores, where streams plunge toward the MBH, with encore luminosities peaking at times corresponding to the freefall timescale and one orbital period, respectively. Across all simulated cases, we find these events exhibit luminosities of $10^{40}-10^{42}$ erg/s with lightcurves characteristic of their morphology. Our work greatly improves the predictions of TDEE lightcurves and empowers observations to probe into NSC dynamics and sBH population while providing possible explanations for anomalous TDE-like flares.
#### Galactic Alchemy: Deep Learning Map-to-Map Translation in Hydrodynamical Simulations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23768

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first systematic study of multi-domain map-to-map translation in galaxy formation simulations, leveraging deep generative models to predict diverse galactic properties. Using high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical simulation data, we compare conditional generative adversarial networks and diffusion models under unified preprocessing and evaluation, optimizing architectures and attention mechanisms for physical fidelity on galactic scales. Our approach jointly addresses seven astrophysical domains - including dark matter, gas, neutral hydrogen, stellar mass, temperature, and magnetic field strength - while introducing physics-aware evaluation metrics that quantify structural realism beyond standard computer vision measures. We demonstrate that translation difficulty correlates with physical coupling, achieving near-perfect fidelity for mappings from gas to dark matter and mappings involving astro-chemical components such as total gas to HI content, while identifying fundamental challenges in weakly constrained tasks such as gas to stellar mass mappings. Our results establish GAN-based models as competitive counterparts to state-of-the-art diffusion approaches at a fraction of the computational cost (in training and inference), paving the way for scalable, physics-aware generative frameworks for forward modelling and observational reconstruction in the SKA era.
#### Clustering properties of the CatWISE2020 quasar catalogue and their impact on the cosmic dipole anomaly

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic dipole anomaly -- the observation of a significant mismatch between the dipole observed in the matter distribution and that expected given the kinematic interpretation of the cosmic microwave background dipole -- poses a serious challenge to the Cosmological Principle upon which the standard model of cosmology rests. Measurements of the dipole ($\ell=1$) in a given sample crucially depend on having control over other large-scale power ($\ell > 1$) so as to avoid biases, in particular those potentially caused by correlations among multipoles during fitting, and those by local source clustering. Currently, the most powerful catalogue that exhibits the cosmic dipole anomaly is the sample of 1.6~million mid-infrared quasars derived from CatWISE2020. We therefore analyse clustering properties of this catalogue by performing an inference analysis of large-scale multipoles in real space, and by computing its angular power spectrum on small scales to test for convergence with $\Lambda$CDM. After accounting for the known trend of the quasar number counts with ecliptic latitude, we find that any other large-scale power is consistent with noise, find no evidence for the presence of an octupole ($\ell=3$) in the data, and quantify the clustering dipole's proportion to be marginal. Our results therefore reaffirm the anomalously high dipole in the distribution of quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star passes within the tidal radius of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). In TDEs it is expected that the orbital angular momentum of the disrupted star is generally misaligned with the SMBH spin axis, which should result in a misaligned super-Eddington disk precessing around the SMBH spin axis due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In this paper, we investigate the distinct observational signatures produced from such TDE disks, by performing radiative transfer calculations upon previous super-Eddington disk simulations. We demonstrate that the precession of the disk and wind drive time-dependent obscuration and reprocessing of X-ray radiation. Depending on the orientation of the viewing angle of the observer and the tilt angle of the disk, four main types of variability are induced: 1) The smooth-TDEs: The emissions from these TDEs show no fluctuations; 2) The dimmer: The main emission type (X-ray or optical) stays the same, with small to moderate modulations of brightness; 3) The blinker: X-ray and optical emissions take turns to dominate in one cycle of precession, with dramatic changes in the X-ray fluxes. 4) The siren: X-ray and optical emissions take over each other twice per cycle, possibly with two different peak X-ray fluxes within one cycle. In all three scenarios, we observe an inverse correlation between X-ray and optical emissions. Our model provides a unified physical framework for interpreting TDE multi-wavelength variability through disk precession dynamics and gives an alternative interpretation to the interesting case of J045650.3-203750 which was suggested to be a repeated partial TDE previously.
#### Radiatively-Cooled Mass Transfer: Disk Properties and L2 outflows across Mass Transfer Rates

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24127

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24127

 - **Abstract**
 High rates of stable mass transfer (MT) occur for some binary star systems, resulting in luminous transients and circumbinary outflows. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a $10 \ M_\odot$ donor star and a $5\ M_\odot$ point mass secondary, incorporating approximate effects of radiative cooling. By varying the orbital separation of the system, we probe MT rates between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1} M_\odot$/yr. Mass flows from the donor into an accretion disk, with significant equatorially-concentrated outflows through the outer Lagrange point L2 occurring for MT rates $\gtrsim 10^{-3} M_\odot$/yr, while the MT remaining mostly conservative for lower MT rates. In all cases, any outflowing gas approximately carries the specific angular momentum of L2. The gas cooling luminosity $L$ and temperature increases with MT rate, with $L \sim 10^{5} L_\odot$ and $T \sim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$ for simulations featuring the strongest outflows, with contributions from both the accretion disk and circumbinary outflow. The most luminous transients associated with mass outflows will be rare due to the high MT rate requirement, but generate significant optical emission from both the accretor's disk and the circumbinary outflow.
#### Eppur si eclissa: Eccentric low-mass companions and time-in-dust selection explain long secondary periods

 - **Abstract**
 [abbreviated] Long Secondary Periods (LSPs) are observed in about one third of pulsating red giants yet remain unexplained. Four key observational constraints anchor the discussion: (i) a roughly 30 percent occurrence rate in semi-regular variable AGB stars (SRVs), with a much lower rate or absence in regularly pulsating Mira-type AGB stars (Miras), (ii) about 50 percent of LSP stars show a secondary mid-infrared minimum, (iii) Keplerian fits to radial-velocity curves favor argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees, and (iv) the radial-velocity to light-curve phase lag clusters around minus 90 degrees. We test whether a close-in, eccentric, low-mass companion that spends only part of its orbit within the giant's dust-formation zone can match all four empirical constraints. Guided by observed radial-velocity amplitudes and periods of about 500 to 1500 days, we adopt companion masses of 0.08 to 0.25 solar masses, orbital separations of 1.5 to 3 AU, eccentricities up to 0.6, and dust condensation radii of about 2.5 to 3 AU for SRVs (larger for Miras via scaling with luminosity). We compute the fraction of the orbit spent outside the condensation radius and apply line-of-sight criteria for detectability. We test the first three empirical constraints analytically, then model the phase offset using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Our scenario explains the observed excess of systems with argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees and yields LSP detectability of about 27 percent for SRVs and about 2.5 percent for Miras, with a conditional secondary mid-infrared eclipse fraction of about 44 percent. The hydrodynamical models place the optical-depth maximum downstream of the companion near apastron and then shift it forward by roughly 90 to 225 degrees later in the orbit, consistent with the observed radial-velocity to light-curve offsets.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are essential tools for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. While they reproduce many key observed properties of galaxies, their limited volumes have hindered comprehensive studies of the AGN and quasar populations. In this work, we leverage the FLAMINGO simulation suite, focusing on its large $(2.8$ $\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ volume, to investigate two key observables of quasar activity: the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and quasar clustering. FLAMINGO reproduces the observed QLF at low redshift ($z \lesssim 1$) and for faint quasars ($L_\mathrm{bol} \lesssim 10^{45}$ $\mathrm{erg s^{-1}}$), but significantly underpredicts the abundance of bright quasars at $z \approx 1$-$3$. Introducing a 0.75 dex log-normal luminosity scatter to represent unresolved small-scale variability boosts the number of bright quasars by upscattering lower-luminosity systems, thereby improving agreement with observations at the bright end. A decomposition of the QLF by black hole mass reveals that this boost is primarily driven by low-mass black holes radiating above the Eddington limit. Nevertheless, limitations remain in fully reproducing the rise and decline of the bright quasar population over cosmic time and in matching the black hole masses inferred from quasar spectra. Thanks to FLAMINGO's large volume, we can robustly sample rare, luminous quasars and measure their spatial clustering for $\log_{10} L_\mathrm{bol}/\mathrm{erg s^{-1}} \gtrsim 45.5$. The simulation reproduces the observed clustering across $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$, and the reduced luminosity dependence introduced by scatter aligns with observational trends. However, it underpredicts the clustering strength at $z \approx 4$, consistent with other models and possibly reflecting high-redshift observational uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed chemical analysis study of 16 candidate metal-poor stars, previously identified with 2dF+AAOmega, using X-Shooter spectra and the Korg 1D LTE spectral synthesis code. We generally confirm the earlier metallicity estimates and reveal four EMP ([Fe/H] $< -3$) stars in the current sample. Two of these stars, including the most metal-poor at [Fe/H] = $-3.83 \pm 0.07$, are kinematically associated with the GSE accretion event, increasing the number of known GSE stars with [Fe/H] $< -3.5$ to eight. From the X-Shooter spectra we also determine abundances for 16 elements, with the element-to-iron abundance ratios generally consistent with high-resolution studies of Galactic halo stars. Within the sample, we identify three peculiar stars: the first is a GSE nitrogen enhanced metal poor (NEMP; [N/Fe] $= 1.62 \pm 0.10$ and [C/Fe] $= 0.27 \pm 0.08$) star with unusually high Na ([Na/Fe] $= 2.28 \pm 0.07$) and Li (A(Li)$_{\rm 3DNLTE} = 1.90 \pm 0.08$) abundances, but which lacks any enhancement in [Al/Fe] or [Mg/Fe]. The second is a halo r-II star significantly enhanced in Sr ([Sr/Ba] $= 0.37 \pm 0.08$), suggesting mixture of r-process and s-process enrichment, uncommon for r-II stars. Whilst the third is a halo star very depleted in N ([N/Fe] $< -1.13$), with low C ([C/Fe] $= -0.36 \pm 0.08$) and otherwise 'normal' [X/Fe] abundances, suggesting enrichment with Type II supernova that proceeds enrichment from massive AGB stars. This study reveals the substantial degree of chemical diversity in the stellar populations which assembled the early Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple populations (MPs) is a intra-star cluster phenomenon consisting in star-to- star variation of the abundance of some light chemical elements. They have been observed in many star clusters, most of them old globular clusters, populating the Milky Way and other satellite galaxies. Since the study of MPs became more system- atic, different astrophysical parameters have been claimed to be the main responsible for its occurrence. However, at the present time, no attempt would seem to have solved this conundrum. This work deals with a potential trigger of the MPs phenomenon, based on the gathered observational evidence of the existence of MPs in some star clusters and the absence of its in others. We found that star clusters with MPs mostly formed during time intervals of intense star formation activity in a galaxy, for instance during the galaxy formation epoch, a close galaxy encounter, etc. At those time inter- vals where relative peaks in the galaxy star formation rate occur, star clusters with masses above a lower mass limit harbour MPs. This lower star cluster mass limit would marginally depend on the star cluster age.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern simulations and observations in Astronomy & Cosmology (A&C) produce massively large data volumes, posing significant challenges for storage, access and data analysis. A long-standing bottleneck in high-performance computing, especially now in the exascale era, has been the requirement to write these large datasets to disks, which limits the performance. A promising solution to this challenge is in-situ processing, where analysis and visualization are performed concurrently with the simulation itself, bypassing the storage of the simulation data. In this work, we present new results from an approach for in-situ processing based on Hecuba, a framework that provides a highly distributed database for streaming A&C simulation data directly into the visualization pipeline to make possible on-line visualization. By integrating Hecuba with the high-performance cosmological simulator ChaNGa, we enable real-time, in-situ visualization of N-body simulation results using tools such as ParaView and VisIVO.

 - **Abstract**
 Late-time light curve plateaus in tidal disruption events (TDEs) are often approximated as flat and time-independent. This simplification is motivated by theoretical modeling of spreading late time TDE disks, which often predicts slow light curve evolution. However, if time evolution can be detected, late-time light curves will yield more information than has been previously accessible. In this work, we re-examine late-time TDE data to test how well the flat plateau assumption holds. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the maximum likelihood for a family of theory-agnostic models and apply the Akaike information criterion to find that that roughly one third of our sample favors evolving plateaus, one third favors truly flat plateaus, and one third shows no statistically significant evidence for any plateau. Next, we refit the TDEs that exhibit statistically significant plateaus using a magnetically elevated $\alpha$-disk model, motivated by the lack of clear thermal instability in late time TDE light curves. From these model-dependent fits, we obtain estimates for the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, the mass of the disrupted star, and the $\alpha$ parameter itself. Fitted $\alpha$ values range from $10^{-3}$ to 0.4 (the mean fitted $\alpha=10^{-1.8}$, with scatter of 0.6 dex), broadly consistent with results from magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we estimate the timescales of disk precession in magnetically elevated TDE models. Theoretically, we find that disk precession times may be orders of magnitude shorter than in unmagnetized Shakura-Sunyaev disks, and grow in time as $T_{\rm prec}\propto t^{35/36}$; empirically, by using fitted $\alpha$ parameters, we estimate that late time disks may experience $\sim$few-10 precession cycles.
