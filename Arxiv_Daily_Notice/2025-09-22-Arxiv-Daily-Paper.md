 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse dwarf galaxies, and particularly ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs), challenge our understanding of galaxy formation and the role of dark matter due to their large sizes, low surface brightness, and varying dark matter content. In this work, we investigate the gas-rich diffuse dwarf galaxy WALLABY J125956-192430 (aka. KK176) using high-resolution HI data from the WALLABY survey. We produce the most reliable kinematic model for KK176 to date. Using this model, the derived mass decomposition shows that KK176 is dark matter dominated. We also place KK176 on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (bTFR), finding that it is consistent with low-mass dwarf galaxies but distinctly different from reported dark matter-deficient UDGs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of three new low-latitude (|b| ~ 20$^{\circ}$) Milky Way satellites: Yasone-1, Yasone-2, and Yasone-3. They were identified in our search for compact stellar overdensities in the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1, supported by follow-up deep photometric imaging from the Gran Telescopio Canarias OSIRIS instrument and Gaia astrometric data. These three new Milky Way satellites are found as compact stellar overdensities that exhibit structural and photometric properties consistent with old, metal-poor populations. All three are best described by isochrone fits corresponding to an age of ~12 Gyr and subsolar metallicities: [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 for Yasone-1 and Yasone-2, and [Fe/H] ~ -2.0 for Yasone-3. Yasone-1, located at a heliocentric distance of 12 kpc, has a physical half-light radius of 1.40 pc, an absolute V-band magnitude of +2.36, and a total stellar mass of 18.2 M$_{\odot}$. Yasone-2, at a distance of 20 kpc, has a slightly larger size of 2.44 pc, a brighter V-band magnitude of +1.83, and a higher mass of 28.0 M$_{\odot}$. Yasone-3, located at 15 kpc, is the faintest and least massive of the three, with M$_{V}$ = +2.52, a stellar mass of 14.4 M$_{\odot}$, and a half-light radius of 2.09 pc. We also report a fourth (Yasone-4), lower-confidence hypercompact candidate located at Galactic latitude (b ~ 48$^{\circ}$), identified by replicating our search using the photometric catalogue of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Public Release. Finally, we present the discovery of sixteen (Yasone-5 to Yasone-20) new hypercompact cluster candidates in the Galactic disc. We discuss the possibility that any of the Yasone clusters may host an intermediate-mass black hole, and we advocate for follow-up spectroscopic observations to further constrain their nature.
#### Spatially non-parametric recovery of intrinsic kinematic maps in pre- to post-merger galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce an adaptable kinematic modelling tool called ROHSA-SNAPD, "Spatially Non-parametric Approach to PSF Deconvolution using ROHSA". ROHSA-SNAPD utilises kinematic regularisation to forward model the intrinsic emission-line flux and kinematics (velocity and linewidth) of 3D data cubes. Kinematic regularisation removes the need to assume an underlying rotation model (eg. exponential disc, tilted-ring) to deconvolve kinematic data. We evaluate the code on mock observations of simulated galaxies: one idealised disc model and three more complex galaxies from a cosmological simulation with varying levels of kinematic disturbance, from pre-merger to post-merger state. The mock observations are designed to approximate published results at $z\sim 1-2$ from 8-metre class near-infrared spectroscopic facilities, using realistic observational parameters including spatial and spectral resolution, noise and point spread function. We demonstrate that ROHSA-SNAPD can effectively recover the intrinsic kinematics of complex systems whilst accounting for observational effects. ROHSA-SNAPD is publicly released on Github.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method to search for strong gravitational lensing systems by pairing spectra that are close together on the sky in a spectroscopic survey. We visually inspect 26,621 spectra in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 that are selected in this way. We further inspect the 11,848 images corresponding to these spectra in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10, and obtain 2046 conventional strong gravitational lens candidates, of which 1906 are new. This constitutes the largest sample of lens candidates identified to date in spectroscopic data. Besides the conventional candidates, we identify a new class of systems that we term "dimple lenses". These systems have a low-mass foreground galaxy as a lens, typically smaller in angular extent and fainter compared with the lensed background source galaxy, producing subtle surface brightness indentations in the latter. We report the discovery of 318 of these "dimple-lens" candidates. We suspect that these represent dwarf galaxy lensing. With follow-up observations, they could offer a new avenue to test the cold dark matter model by probing their mass profiles, stellar mass-halo mass relation, and halo mass function for $M_{\textrm{Halo}} \lesssim 10^{13}\,M_\odot$. Thus, in total, we report 2164 new lens candidates. Our method demonstrates the power of pairwise spectroscopic analysis and provides a pathway complementary to imaging-based and single-spectrum lens searches.
#### REBELS-IFU: on the origin of the elevated [OIII]/[CII] ratios in the early Universe

 - **Abstract**
 We present new ALMA [OIII]$_{88}$ observations of eight previously [CII]$_{158}$-detected galaxies at $6.8 \lesssim z \lesssim 7.7$. Six of our targets -- the primary sample -- are massive, UV-luminous galaxies drawn from the REBELS survey, while the remaining two are UV-fainter galaxies that were previously serendipitously detected through their luminous [CII] lines in the REBELS fields. We detect [OIII]$_{88}$ emission in all eight galaxies at $6.2 - 17.7\sigma$ significance, and find them to be consistent with the local dwarf galaxy relation between $L_\mathrm{[OIII]}$ and star formation rate. Our sample spans [OIII]/[CII] $\approx 1.9 - 9.6$, which is typical for the high-redshift galaxy population. Five of the primary targets benefit from JWST/NIRSpec observations, enabling a direct comparison of the [OIII]/[CII] ratio against rest-optical ISM diagnostics. We supplement our high-redshift sample with eleven $z\approx6-14$ galaxies in the literature for which similar ALMA and JWST observations are available, and furthermore compare to the [OIII]/[CII] ratios measured for local dwarf galaxies. We find that, at fixed metallicity and ionization parameter, $z>6$ galaxies show elevated [OIII]/[CII] ratios compared to local dwarfs. Instead, we find that a large [OIII]$_{4959,5007}$+H$\beta$ equivalent width -- a proxy for burstiness -- is the main driver of the high [OIII]/[CII] ratios seen in the early Universe, which is primarily due to [CII] being suppressed in bursty galaxies. Given the apparent validity of the [OIII]$_{88}$-SFR relation across most of cosmic time, as well as the abundance of young, bursty galaxies at high redshift, [OIII]$_{88}$ is set to remain a powerful ISM tracer at the cosmic dawn.
#### The Nature of High-Redshift Massive Quiescent Galaxies -- Searching for RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 in FLARES

 - **Abstract**
 RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 (RQG) is the earliest massive quiescent galaxy identified to date, inferred to have formed its abundant stellar mass in a single burst that ceases rapidly before $z \sim 8$. An object of such extreme nature challenges our understanding of galaxy formation, requiring rapid growth and quenching mechanisms only 0.6 Gyr after the Big Bang and implying number densities 2 dex higher than currently predicted by simulations. We use synthetic observables to identify analogous systems within the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) and find two massive galaxies dominated by rapidly quenched bursts. Beyond demonstrating that the current FLARES model is capable of producing RQG-like systems, these analogues provide a laboratory within which to study the underlying physics. Their active galactic nuclei (AGN) heat and expel gas, inducing rapid quenching and preventing timely rejuvenation. This causes above-average chemical enrichment at a given stellar mass, with super solar levels predicted for RQG. These metallicities are underestimated by spectral energy distribution fitting and we show that $\alpha$-enhancement cannot be solely responsible. Degeneracies with age and dust attenuation appear the more likely causes. Tensions between observed and simulated number densities can be alleviated in part by considering systematics, but adjustments to AGN feedback, such as allowing super-Eddington accretion rates, may be required for full agreement.
#### Two-phase formation of galaxies: the coevolution between galaxies and dark matter halos

 - **Abstract**
 We use FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the co-evolution between Milky Way-size galaxies and their host dark matter halos. We find that the formation of these galaxies follows a two-phase pattern, with an early phase featured by hot dynamics, bulge-dominated structure and bursty star formation, and a later phase featured by cold dynamics, disk-dominated structure and steady star formation. The transition times of these galaxy properties are tightly correlated with the time when the host halo transits from fast to slow accretion, suggesting that the two-phase assembly of halos drive the two-phase formation of galaxies. The physical origin of dynamical hotness can be summarized into two modes of star formation: a scattered mode in which stars form at large radii within cold gas streams associated with fast assembly of halos, and a concentrated mode in which stars form at small radii through violent fragmentation from globally self-gravitated gas when halo assembly is about to slow down. Cold gaseous and stellar disks can form only when the conditions of the two modes are removed by the stall of halo assembly and the reduction of gas by feedback processes. The two modes of star formation leave distinct imprints on the structural properties of high-redshift galaxies, providing implications to be tested by JWST and future observations.
