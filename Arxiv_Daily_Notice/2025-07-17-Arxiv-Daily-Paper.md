 - **Abstract**
 Emission and absorption line features are important diagnostics for the physics underlying extragalactic astronomy. The interpretation of observed signatures involves comparing against forward modeled spectra from galaxy formation simulations as well as more simplified geometries, while including the complex scattering radiative transfer (RT) of resonant emission lines. Here, we present thor, a modern C++ radiative transfer code focused initially on resonant emission lines. thor is a high-performance, distributed memory MPI-parallel, multi-target code, running on CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators, yielding large $\sim 10-50\rm{x}$ speed-ups compared to previous CPU-only codes. We support multiple grid-based and gridless data structures, enabling comparisons across different hydrodynamical codes as well as toy model geometries. We demonstrate its science capabilities with a number of example use cases across scales: (i) Lyman-alpha RT on simple shell-like gas distributions; (ii) Lyman-alpha RT applied to a high-resolution, high-redshift $z \sim 6$ cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation; (iii) Lyman-alpha and Magnesium-II halos, i.e. scattering and emission from the circumgalactic medium of $z \simeq 1-2$ galaxies drawn from cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations; (iv) the large-scale cosmic web in gas emission, a $6144^3$ volume-element RT scaling calculation; and (v) synthetic absorption spectra of the Lyman-alpha forest. Extensive verification and benchmarking validates our approach and its computational efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have long been recognized as key probes of early black hole growth and galaxy evolution. However, modeling this population remains difficult due to the wide range of luminosities and black hole masses involved, and the high computational costs of capturing the hydrodynamic response of gas and evolving radiation fields on-the-fly. In this study, we present a new suite of simulations based on the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation framework, enhanced with on-the-fly radiative transfer, to examine AGN at high redshift (z > 5) in a protocluster environment extracted from the MillenniumTNG simulation. We focus on the co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies, as well as the radiative impact on surrounding intergalactic gas. The model predicts that black holes form in overdense regions and lie below the local black hole-stellar mass relation, with stellar mass assembly preceding significant black hole accretion. Ionizing photons are primarily produced by stars, which shape the morphology of ionized regions and drive reionization. Given the restrictive black hole growth in the original IllustrisTNG model, we reduce the radiative efficiency from 0.2 to 0.1, resulting in higher accretion rates for massive black holes, more bursty growth, and earlier AGN-driven quenching. However, the resulting AGN remain significantly fainter than observed high-redshift quasars. As such, to incorporate this missing population, we introduce a quasar boosted model, in which we artificially boost the AGN luminosity. This results in strong effects on the surrounding gas, most notably a proximity effect, and large contributions to He ionization.
#### DELVE-ing into the Milky Way's Globular Clusters: Assessing extra-tidal features in NGC 5897, NGC 7492, and testing detectability with deeper photometry

 - **Abstract**
 Extra-tidal features around globular clusters (GCs) are tracers of their disruption, stellar stream formation, and their host's gravitational potential. However, these features remain challenging to detect due to their low surface brightness. We conduct a systematic search for such features around 19 GCs in the DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) survey Data Release 2, discovering a new extra-tidal envelope around NGC 5897 and find tentative evidence for an extended envelope surrounding NGC 7492. Through a combination of dynamical modeling and analyzing synthetic stellar populations, we demonstrate these envelopes may have formed through tidal disruption. We use these models to explore the detectability of these features in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), finding that while LSST's deeper photometry will enhance detection significance, additional methods for foreground removal like proper motions or metallicities may be important for robust stream detection. Our results both add to the sample of globular clusters with extra-tidal features and provide insights on interpreting similar features in current and upcoming data.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the granulation background signal is of vital importance when interpreting the asteroseismic diagnostics of solar-like oscillators. Various descriptions exist in the literature for modelling the surface manifestation of convection, the choice of which affects our interpretations. We aim to evaluate the performance of and preference for various granulation background models for a suite of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of convection across the HR diagram, thereby expanding the number of simulations and coverage of parameter space for which such studies have been made. We take a statistical approach by considering the granulation in power density spectra of 3D simulations, where no biases or systematics of observational origin are present. To properly contrast the performance of the models, we develop a Bayesian nested sampling framework for model inference and comparison. This framework was extended to real stellar data using KIC 8006161 (Doris) and the Sun. We find that multi-component models are consistently preferred over a single-component model, with each tested multi-component model demonstrating merit in specific cases. This occurs for simulations with no magnetic activity, thus ruling out stellar faculae as the sole source of the second granulation component. Like a previous study, we find that a hybrid model with a single overall amplitude and two characteristic frequencies performs well for numerous simulations. Additionally, a tentative third granulation component beyond the value of $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ is seen for some simulations, but its potential presence in observations requires further efforts. Studying the granulation signatures in these simulations paves the way to studying stars with accurate granulation models. This deeper understanding of the granulation signal may lead to complementary methods to existing algorithms for determining stellar parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a view of the stellar halo in the inner-central regions of the Milky Way (R <~ 10 kpc) mapped by RR Lyrae stars. The combined BRAVA-RR/APOGEE RR Lyrae catalog is used to obtain a sample of 281 RR Lyrae stars located in the bulge region of the Galaxy, but with orbits indicating they belong to the inner-central halo. The RR Lyrae stars in the halo are more metal-poor than the bulge RR Lyrae stars and have pulsation properties more consistent with an accreted population. We use the Milky Way-like zoom-in cosmological simulation Auriga to compare the properties of the RR Lyrae stars to those expected from the "Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage" (GES) merger. The integrals of motions and eccentricities of the RR Lyrae stars are consistent with a small fraction of 6-9 +- 2 % of the inner-central halo RR Lyrae population having originated from GES. This fraction, lower than what is seen in the solar neighborhood, is consistent with trends seen in the Auriga simulation, where a GES-like merger would have a decreasing fraction of GES stars at small Galactocentric radii compared to other accreted populations. Very few of the Auriga inner Galaxy GES-18 particles have properties consistent with belonging to a bulge population with (z_max < 1.1 kpc), indicating that no (or very few) RR Lyrae stars with bulge orbits should have originated from GES.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) have provided a new lens through which to view the universe beyond traditional electromagnetic methods. The upcoming space-based gravitational wave mission, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will give us the first glimpse of the sky in mHz gravitational waves, a waveband that contains a rich variety of sources including massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers. In this work, we investigate the spatial distribution of MBBH mergers versus the galaxy distribution to determine how well LISA could be used as a unique and independent probe of large-scale structure. We compare the two-point correlation function (2pt CF) of MBBH mergers to that of galaxies within the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG. Our results show that MBBH mergers exhibit stronger clustering than galaxies at scales less than 10 Mpc $h^{-1}$, particularly at higher redshifts, and that the bias is relatively constant as a function of separation. These findings imply that the spatial distribution of MBBH mergers detectable by LISA could inform the observed galaxy distribution. In addition, this implies that searches for a cosmological background in LISA data could use a prior derived from large-scale structure observations to subtract the MBBH foreground.

 - **Abstract**
 The spatial diffusion of energetic particles in a magnetic field composed of a large-scale background and a small-scale turbulent component should be expected to be anisotropic. While such anisotropic diffusion has been known for quite a while in first-principle plasma physics and while it is required for an understanding of the transport of cosmic rays in the heliosphere or close to supernova remnants, only in recent years it has also become of particular interest for the modeling of Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) transport in the Milky Way in the context of their residence time and their (local) energy spectra. Also, the large-scale spatial distribution of GCRs is shaped by an anisotropic diffusion in the Galactic magnetic field, which should directly affect both the diffuse gamma-ray and the neutrino emission. We solve the anisotropic diffusive transport of GCRs in the Milky Way using the publicly available transport code CRPropa. The anisotropy of the diffusion is characterized by the ratio between the diffusion coefficient perpendicular and parallel to the local magnetic field $\epsilon = D_\perp / D_\parallel$, where we test different values reaching from nearly parallel transport ($\epsilon = 10^{-3}$) to more isotropic diffusion ($\epsilon = 10^{-1}$). From the three dimensional distribution of GCRs in the Milky Way we calculate the all-sky gamma-ray emission, using the line-of-sight integration framework HERMES. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of the anisotropy in the diffusion on the spatial distribution of the gamma-ray flux and its spectral energy distribution. It shows strong influences by the anisotropy of the diffusion and the magnetic field geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 We present two extensive sets of 3500+1000 simulations of dark matter haloes on the past light cone, and two corresponding sets of simulated (`mock') galaxy catalogues that represent the Euclid spectroscopic sample. The simulations were produced with the latest version of the PINOCCHIO code, and provide the largest, public set of simulated skies. Mock galaxy catalogues were obtained by populating haloes with galaxies using an halo occupation distribution (HOD) model extracted from the Flagship galaxy catalogue provided by Euclid Collaboration. The Geppetto set of 3500 simulated skies was obtained by tiling a 1.2 Gpc/h box to cover a light-cone whose sky footprint is a circle of 30 deg radius, for an area of 2763 deg$^2$ and a minimum halo mass of $1.5\times10^{11}$ Msun/h. The relatively small box size makes this set unfit for measuring very large scales. The EuclidLargeBox set consists of 1000 simulations of 3.38 Gpc/h, with the same mass resolution and a footprint that covers half of the sky, excluding the Milky Way zone of avoidance. From this we produced a set of 1000 EuclidLargeMocks on the 30 deg radius footprint, whose comoving volume is fully contained in the simulation box. We validated the two sets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point correlation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is consistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although we noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k>0.2 h/Mpc. We show cosmological parameter inference from these catalogues and demonstrate that using one realisation of EuclidLargeMocks in place of the Flagship mock produces the same posteriors, to within the expected shift given by sample variance. These simulated skies will be used for the galaxy clustering analysis of Euclid's Data Release 1 (DR1).
#### Measuring the IGM correlation length at 5<z<6.1: a fast change at the end of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of high redshift quasars is a powerful probe of the late stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), particularly through the presence of Gunn-Peterson troughs. These troughs span a broad range of lengths (up to $\sim 100$ Mpc), suggesting large-scale coherent structures in the intergalactic medium. We aim to gain insight into the presence, extent, and magnitude of correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at $5<z<6.1$, and to quantify the scales over which correlations are significant to inform on the necessary volume for simulating the EoR. Using the extended XQR-30 dataset and accounting for the relevant systematics, we compute the flux correlation matrix and perform an MCMC analysis to quantify the extent and strength of the correlation. To interpret our results, we compare to $1.5^3,\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ lightcones of Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission fluxes from several reionization scenarios, including a fiducial box employing SCRIPT. We detect strong correlations at $z > 5.3$, extending at least tens of Mpc and strongly increasing with redshift. Our results suggest a redshift-dependent correlation length, from $L \leq 26.53\, (68.47)$ Mpc at 1-$\sigma$ (2-$\sigma$) limit at $z = 5.0$ to $L = 252.72^{+272.61}_{-41.61}$ Mpc at $z = 6.1$. In contrast, all simulation models predict shorter correlation lengths ($< 60$ Mpc) and a slower redshift evolution. The presence and redshift-dependence of correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest on $>200$ Mpc scales at $z=6$ indicates that cosmological simulations should be larger than this scale to adequately sample the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Despite implementing a fluctuating UVB and numerous neutral islands at $z<6$, our fiducial SCRIPT-based simulation fails to reproduce the large-scale correlations. It may be that those ingredients are necessary, but not sufficient, to understanding the unfolding of the EoR.
#### Unveiling the galactic baryon cycle process by an empirical model

 - **Abstract**
 We propose an empirical model to describe and constrain the baryon cycle process during galaxy evolution. This model utilizes the evolution of star formation rate, derived from the stellar mass-halo mass relations (SHMRs) across different redshifts, and the cold gas content, derived from the NeutralUniverseMachine model, to constrain gas accretion and recycle of gas outflow in the model galaxy. Additionally, through detailed modeling of each cycle process, particularly the recycling process, and utilizing the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z=0$ as a constraint, our model establishes a relation between the recycle fraction and halo mass. It is found that the fraction of gas recycled from the outflow is a function of halo mass, with a value of $25\%$ in galaxies with halo mass $\sim10^{10.4}M_{\rm \odot}$, increasing to $75\%$ in halos with mass $\sim 10^{12}M_{\rm \odot}$. We also find that the mass loading factor from the FIRE-2 simulation matches well with the constraints from both observational data and our model. Furthermore, using the gas content and metallicity of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) obtained from hydrodynamical simulations as constraints, our model predicts that on average $70\%$ of universal baryon accretion is accreted to the halo and $80\%$ of the non-recycled gas in the outflow has escaped from the galaxy, entering the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, we note that future observational data are needed to finally constrain the mass and metal exchange between the CGM and the IGM.
#### All-sky search for short gravitational-wave bursts in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run

 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the first eight months of Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run, denoted O4a. We use four analyses which are sensitive to a wide range of potential signals lasting up to a few seconds in the 16-4096 Hz band. Excluding binary black hole merger candidates that were already identified by low-latency analyses, we find no statistically significant evidence for other gravitational-wave transients. We measure the sensitivity of the search for representative signals, including sine-Gaussians, Gaussian pulses, and white-noise bursts with different frequencies and durations, adopting a false alarm rate of 1 per 100 years as detection threshold. Depending on signal type, we find improvements over previous searches by factors of 2 to 10 in terms of sensitivity to strain amplitude and of 90% confidence upper limit on the rate density of sources. We also evaluate a variety of core-collapse supernova models and find that, for some models, the search could have detected gravitational waves from stellar core-collapse throughout the Milky Way. Finally, we consider neutron star f-modes associated with pulsar glitches and find that, assuming a source similar to the Vela Pulsar, the search could have detected a gravitational-wave signal from a glitch with fractional frequency change as small as $\sim 2$ to $6 \times 10^{-5}$ depending on the neutron star mass.
