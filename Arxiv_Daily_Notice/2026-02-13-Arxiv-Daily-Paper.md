 - **Abstract**
 Recently discovered quasar pairs at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim$5) are likely precursors to supermassive black hole mergers, providing a promising window to high redshift quasar growth mechanisms. However, the large uncertainties on their relative distances along the line-of-sight ($d_{\rm l.o.s.}$) limits our ability to characterize quasar pairs. In this study, we explore synthetic quasar proximity zone spectra as an alternative method to constrain the line-of-sight distance of quasar pairs. We find that for small sky-plane separations ($d_{\rm sky}\approx 10-100$ pkpc), a simple peak finding algorithm can easily distinguish between scenarios of $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \lesssim1$ pMpc and $\gtrsim1$ pMpc. For cases where the true $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \geq 3$ pMpc, the accuracy of $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimation is $\approx 0.2$ pMpc. Large sky-plane separations of $d_{\rm sky}=1$ pMpc have larger absolute uncertainties in $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimates, but the method can still easily distinguish between scenarios where $d_{\rm l.o.s.}\lesssim4$ pMpc and $\gtrsim4$ pMpc. $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimates have an uncertainty of $\approx$0.5 pMpc when true $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \gtrsim4$ pMpc. Our proof-of-concept study illustrates the potential use of quasar proximity zones to constrain the 3-dimensional quasar pair configuration, providing an avenue to characterize quasar pairs.

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the nebular attenuation curve and investigate dust geometry in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon using photometric medium-band emission line measurements. We measure H-alpha emission line fluxes for a sample of 209 star-forming galaxies at 1.2<z<2.4 in MegaScience/UNCOVER with stellar masses spanning $7.85<\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot)<11.0$. For 66 of these galaxies, we also measure a Pa-beta flux. We find that the Pa-beta/H-alpha line ratio increases strongly with stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) across our full mass range, indicating that more massive galaxies are dustier. We compare our results with a mass-, SFR-, and redshift-matched sample of galaxies from the MOSDEF survey with spectroscopic measurements of H-alpha/H-beta, finding that a shallow Reddy et al. (2025) nebular attenuation curve is more consistent with our observations than the typically assumed Cardelli et al. (1989) attenuation curve, especially for massive galaxies. This shallow attenuation curve could be explained by low dust covering fractions in star-forming regions. Through comparison to other studies, we show that assuming this shallower attenuation curve can increase the inferred A_Halpha,neb by up to 1 magnitude at high masses. We observe no trend between A_Halpha,neb and axis ratio, indicating that nebular attenuation is likely localized to small clumps. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that dust geometry is patchy and non-uniform, especially in massive galaxies. Our results highlight the ability of JWST medium bands to probe emission lines for large samples of galaxies, and statistically constrain dust properties in upcoming large programs.
#### Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). XXV. Large-scale environments of low-luminosity quasars at $z\sim6$ traced by Ly$α$ emitters

 - **Abstract**
 High-$z$ quasars are believed to reside in massive dark matter haloes (DMHs), suggesting that they reside in galaxy overdense regions. However, previous observations have shown a range of environments around them. The previous targets are limited to bright quasars ($M_{1450}\lesssim-25$), for which photoevaporation may hinder galaxy formation in their vicinity. Here, we present Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam observations of the environments of four low-luminosity quasars ($-24<M_{1450}<-22$) at $z\sim6.18$, which are expected to have a smaller photoevaporation effect. We detect Lyman $\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) around them with narrowband NB872 imaging, and measure the local LAE overdensity. One quasar (J0844$-$0132) resides in an overdense region ($\delta_\mathrm{LAE}=3.77\pm0.97$), whereas the other three fields are consistent with normal fields. The result is confirmed over the proximity zone of each quasar, suggesting that the diverse environment around quasars is independent of photoevaporation. We find no significant correlation between the LAE overdensities and the properties of host galaxies and supermassive black holes. Our quasars have host stellar mass measurements from JWST, allowing us to compare them with the LAE overdensity around galaxies without quasar activity with comparable stellar masses. We find that the LAE overdensity in the J0844$-$0132 field is stronger than that of galaxies with similar stellar mass at $z\sim6$, while the other quasar fields show a comparable LAE overdensity.
#### Characterising Ly$α$ damping wings at the onset of reionisation: Evidence for highly efficient star formation driven by dense, neutral gas in UV-bright galaxies at $z>9$

 - **Abstract**
 One of the major conundrums in contemporary extragalactic astrophysics is the apparent overabundance of a remarkable population of UV-bright galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 9$. We analyse galaxies spectroscopically observed by JWST/NIRSpec Prism and confirmed to lie at $z>9$, with sufficient signal-to-noise to carefully model their rest-frame UV to optical continua and line emission. In particular, we model the damped Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) absorption (DLA) features of each galaxy to place observational constraints on the gas assembly of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) onto the galaxy halos at the onset of cosmic reionisation. Based on the derived HI column densities and star-formation rate (SFR) surface densities, we show that all galaxies are highly efficient at forming stars on rapid $\sim 10-100\,$Myr depletion timescales, greatly in excess compared to the canonical local universe Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and predictions from state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations. The dense HI gas appears to also drive the offset from the fundamental-metallicity relation of these galaxies though its dust-to-gas ratio is seemingly consistent with values derived for local galaxies except for the lowest metallicity sight-lines. Our results provide the first robust observational constraints on the impact of pristine HI gas on early galaxy assembly, and imply that a combination of highly efficient star formation and low dust obscuration can likely explain the UV-brightness of galaxies at cosmic dawn.
#### Reionization Bubbles from Real-Space Cross Correlations of Line Intensity Maps

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new way to reconstruct the ionized-bubble size distribution during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) through the real-space cross-correlation of 21-cm and star-forming line-intensity maps. Understanding the evolution and timing of the EoR is crucial for both astrophysics and cosmology, and a wealth of information on the first sources can be extracted from the study of ionized bubbles. Nevertheless, directly mapping bubbles is challenging due to the high redshifts involved, possible selection biases, and foregrounds in 21-cm maps. Here, we exploit the real-space cross-correlation $\xi_{21,\nu}$ between 21-cm and line-intensity mapping (LIM) signals to reconstruct the evolution of bubble sizes during reionization. For the first time, we show that $\xi_{21,\nu}(r)$ departs from a saturation level for each separation $r$ when bubbles of size $r$ begin to form, providing a handle for the onset of bubbles of each radius. Moreover, we demonstrate that $\xi_{21,\nu}$ evolves from positive to negative as the EoR progresses, reaching a minimum (i.e. maximum anti-correlation) when bubbles of radius $r$ reach peak abundance. We show that these results are robust to changes in the astrophysical model as well as the timing/topology of reionization. This real-space observable complements usual Fourier-space estimators by capturing the localized nature of bubbles, offering new insights into the sources driving cosmic reionization.
