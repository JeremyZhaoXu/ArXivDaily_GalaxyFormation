 - **Abstract**
 The fifth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) is conducting the first all-sky low-resolution spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way's stellar halo. We describe the stellar parameter pipeline for the SDSS-V halo survey, which simultaneously models spectra, broadband photometry, and parallaxes to derive stellar parameters, metallicities, alpha abundances, and distances. The resulting BOSS-MINESweeper catalog is validated across a wide range of stellar parameters and metallicities using star clusters and a comparison to high-resolution spectroscopic surveys. We demonstrate several scientific capabilities of this dataset: identifying the most chemically peculiar stars in our Galaxy, discovering and mapping distant halo substructures, and measuring the all--sky dynamics of the Milky Way on the largest scales. The BOSS-MINESweeper catalog for SDSS DR19 is publicly available and will be updated for future data releases.
#### Star formation histories and gas content limits of three ultra-faint dwarfs on the periphery of M31

 - **Abstract**
 We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of Pegasus V and Pisces VII, along with a re-analysis of the archival imaging of Pegasus W, and Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) neutral gas (HI) observations of all three. These three ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are all within the Local Group in the approximate direction of M31. The VLA observations place stringent upper limits on their HI content, with all having $M_\mathrm{HI} < 10^4\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$. As the red giant branches of these UFDs are sparsely populated, we determined distances from the HST photometry of horizontal branch (HB) stars in comparison to a fiducial HB population (from M92), with all three falling in the range 0.7-1 Mpc. Using a new Python-based star formation history (SFH) fitting code (based on StarFISH), we derive SFHs of all three UFDs. As found previously, the best fit SFH for Pegasus W includes significant star formation well beyond the end of reionization, while the SFHs calculated for Pegasus V and Pisces VII are consistent with them having quenched shortly after reionization. These findings for the latter two objects indicate that, like those in the vicinity of the Milky Way, lower mass UFDs in the vicinity of M31 likely quenched at early times.
#### Challenges to the Two-Infall Scenario by Large Stellar Age Catalogs

 - **Abstract**
 Stars in the Milky Way disk exhibit a clear separation into two chemically distinct populations based on their [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios. This $\alpha$-bimodality is not a universal feature of simulated disk galaxies and may point to a unique evolutionary history. A popular explanation is the two-infall scenario, which postulates that two periods of substantial accretion rates dominate the assembly history of the Galaxy. Thanks to recent advances in stellar age measurements, we can now compare this model to more direct measurements of the Galaxy's evolutionary timescales across the disk. We run multi-zone galactic chemical evolution models with a two-infall-driven star formation history and compare the results against abundance patterns from APOGEE DR17, supplemented with stellar ages estimated through multiple methods. Although the two-infall scenario offers a natural explanation for the $\alpha$-bimodality, it struggles to explain several features of the age--abundance structure in the disk. First, our models generically predict a massive and long-lasting dilution event, but the data show that stellar metallicity is remarkably constant across much of the lifetime of the disk. This apparent age-independence places considerable restrictions upon the two-infall parameter space. Second, most local metal-rich stars in APOGEE have intermediate ages, yet our models predict these stars should either be very old or very young. Some of these issues can be mitigated, but not completely resolved, by pre-enriching the accreted gas to low metallicity. These restrictions also place limits on the role of merger events in shaping the chemical evolution of the thin disk.
#### Disks no more: the morphology of low-mass simulated galaxies in FIREbox

 - **Abstract**
 We study the morphology of hundreds of simulated central galaxies in the stellar mass range $M_\star=10^{7.5} \rm - 10^{11}~$\msun\, from the FIREbox cosmological volume. We demonstrate that FIREbox is able to predict a wide variety of morphologies, spanning from disk-dominated objects to spheroidal galaxies supported by stellar velocity dispersion. However, the simulations predict a strong relation between morphology (degree of rotational support) and stellar mass: galaxies comparable to the Milky Way are often disk-dominated while the presence of stellar disks mostly vanishes for dwarfs with $M_\star <10^9 ~$\msun. This defines a ``morphology transition'' regime for galaxies with $10^9 <M_\star/\rm{M_\odot}< 10^{10}$ in which disks become increasingly common, but below which disks are rare. We show that burstiness in the star formation history and the deepening of the gravitational potential strongly correlate in our simulations with this transition regime, with disks forming in objects with lower levels of burstiness in the last $\sim 6$ Gyr and halos with mass $\sim 10^{11} ~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ and above. While observations support a transition towards thicker disks in the regime of dwarfs, our results are in partial disagreement with observations of at least some largely rotationally supported gas disks in dwarfs with $M_\star < 10^9$\msun. This study highlights dwarf morphology as a fundamental benchmark for testing future galaxy formation models.
#### Estimate of Current Mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud from the Orphan-Chenab Tidal Stream

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01086

 - **Abstract**
 By fitting the tilt in the path of the Orphan-Chenab Stream (OCS), we conclude that the current mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) within 30 kpc is $4.7$ - $5.1 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. We note that the tidal radius of the LMC of this mass is 16.9 kpc, indicating that our measured mass approximates the current bound mass of the LMC. Previous measurements of the LMC mass based on fitting the observed path of the OCS through the Milky Way (MW) halo reported the total mass of the LMC. We show that because the closest approach of the LMC to the OCS, where the gravitational perturbation of the stream path is the highest, is about 20 kpc, the mass of the LMC outside of 30 kpc is not constrained and depends entirely on the assumed radial profile at large radius. Our best-fit total mass varies between $4.5 \times 10^{10}$ and $2.2 \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ or more, depending on the presumed radial profile of the LMC. We also show that previous measurements of the mass of the LMC that used a particle-spray method to simulate the path of the OCS suffered from systematic error because they assumed that all particles were stripped from the dwarf galaxy at the tidal radius; N-body simulations show that particles are actually released from a range of distances from the center of mass of the OCS. In contrast, the choice of MW potential has little effect on the estimated LMC mass from the OCS.
#### Can cosmic rays explain the high ionisation rates in the Galactic centre?

 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), located in the centre of the Milky Way, is a roughly cylindrical structure of molecular gas extending up to parsecs around the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. The average H2 ionisation rate in the CMZ is estimated to be 2e-14 s-1, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than anywhere else in the Galaxy. Due to the high gas density in this region, electromagnetic radiation is rapidly absorbed, leaving low-energy cosmic rays (CRs) as the only effective ionising agents. Hence, a high CR density has been invoked to explain such high ionisation rates. However, a corresponding excess in gamma rays, which would result from interactions of high-energy CRs, has not been observed. This suggests that the supposed excess exists only in the low-energy CR spectrum. To constrain this unknown low-energy component, we first derive the high-energy CR injection spectra using gamma-ray and radio data, to which we add various low-energy components. We then propagate these injection spectra by numerically solving the CR transport equation using a Crank-Nicolson scheme. Testing multiple CR injection scenarios, we find that the energy required to sustain the observed ionisation rates is excessively high in every case. We conclude that CRs cannot be the exclusive ionising agents in the CMZ.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of precise Gaia DR3 astrometry in the LMC region has revealed asymmetric patterns in the bar quadrupole and the disc outskirts of the LMC in-plane velocity maps. We aim to quantify the asymmetries detected in the LMC radial and residual tangential velocity maps, and determine whether they are generated naturally due to the LMC's interaction with the SMC. We analyse the velocity maps of different simulations from the KRATOS suite of N-body simulations of the LMC-SMC-MW system, proposing a new methodology to quantify the kinematic asymmetry in the bar and the outskirts of the disc. We also transform the KRATOS simulations into Gaia mock catalogues to confirm that the asymmetric signature in the LMC is not an effect of observational uncertainties. In addition, we investigate the possibility of a classification bias in the neural network classifier of the Gaia optimal sample. In the KRATOS simulations of the LMC and SMC interaction, the dynamical effect of the SMC passages produces a displacement of the bar and asymmetries in the LMC velocity maps. By comparing the velocity maps of mock catalogues of the future Gaia data releases DR4, DR5 and GaiaNIR, we find that the asymmetric signature in the bar quadrupole is independent of observational errors. We thereby confirm that it is a consequence of the interaction of the LMC with the SMC. We also find a classification bias in the neural network classifier, indicating that the outer disc asymmetry observed in the optimal sample is artificial. The analysis of the KRATOS simulations reveals that the interaction of the LMC with the SMC can generate asymmetric patterns in the velocity field. In the case of the Gaia DR3 LMC velocity maps we conclude that the bar quadrupole asymmetry is directly correlated with the SMC interaction, while the outer disc asymmetry is an artefact of the classifier for the optimal sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic millisecond-duration signals which encode otherwise unattainable information on the plasma which permeates our Universe, providing insights into magnetic fields and gas distributions. Here we report the discovery of FRB 20240304B originating at redshift 2.148 +/- 0.001 corresponding to just 3 billion years after the Big Bang. FRB 2024030 was detected with the MeerKAT radio telescope and localized to a low-mass, clumpy, star forming galaxy using the James Webb Space Telescope. This discovery doubles the redshift reach of localized FRBs and probes ionized baryons across ~80% of cosmic history. Its sightline, intersecting the Virgo Cluster and a foreground group, reveals magnetic field complexity over many gigaparsec scales. Our observations establish FRB activity during the peak of cosmic star formation and demonstrate that FRBs can probe galaxy formation during the most active era in cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial non-Gaussianity is predicted by various inflationary models, and N-body simulations are a crucial tool for studying its imprints on large-scale structure. In this work, we present \texttt{GENGARS} ( GEnerator of Non-Gaussian ARbitrary Shapes), a framework for generating accurate non-Gaussian initial conditions for N-body simulations. It builds upon the formulation introduced by Wagner \& Verde (2012), enabling to generate a primordial gravitational potential with a desired separable bispectrum $B_{\Phi}(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. For the local, equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussian templates, we benchmark our method against the well-established \texttt{2LPT-PNG} code. We show that \texttt{GENGARS} achieves improved accuracy and lower noise by suppressing spurious contributions to the primordial power spectrum. This paper aims at presenting the method, quantifying its performance and illustrating the benefits and applicable use cases over existing approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal features from galaxy mergers, particularly stellar streams, offer valuable insights into galaxy assembly and dark matter halo properties. This paper aims to identify a large sample of nearby stellar streams suitable for detailed modelling and comparison with simulations to enable population-level constraints on halo properties. We visually inspect and compile a tidal feature catalogue for $19,387$ galaxies with redshift $z \leq 0.02$ from the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 using original, model, and residual images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Residual images, produced by subtracting models of all sources, enhance the detectability of faint asymmetries such as tidal features. We find that $11.9 \pm 0.2\%$ of galaxies host tidal features, more frequently around early-type than late-type galaxies. The tidal feature fraction increases with stellar mass, from $2.4 \pm 0.4\%$ at $\sim10^8$M$_\odot$ to $36.5 \pm 1.2\%$ at $\sim 5\times10^{11}$M$_\odot$. From this, we present the first release of STRRINGS: STReams in Residual Images of Nearby GalaxieS, a subsample of 35 galaxies with long, narrow streams suitable for modelling. We segment these streams and derive their geometry, surface brightness, colours, and stellar masses. The median $g$-band surface brightness is 26.8 mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$, reaching 27.5 mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$ for the faintest stream. Mass ratios are consistent with minor mergers, and we identify five potential dwarf galaxy progenitors. Our streams are typically longer (median 124 kpc) than the literature, with comparable widths. Stream mass correlates with length and colour, and wider streams lie at larger galactocentric radii. STRRINGS will be expanded and used to constrain halo properties in future work.
#### Higher order methods for Radiative Transfer in Astrophysical simulations: $\rm P_n$ vs $\rm M_1$

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02453

 - **Abstract**
 In current cosmological simulations, the radiative transfer modules generally rely on the M_1 approximation, which has some glaring flaws related to its fluid-like behaviour, such as spurious pseudo-sources and loss of directionality when radiation fronts from different directions collide. P_n, another moment-based model used in other fields of physics, may correct these issues. We aim at testing out P_n in an astrophysical setting and compare it to M_1, in order to see if it can indeed correct M_1's flaws. Also, we want to use P_n's solutions to better pinpoint M_1 errors. We implement a P_n radiation transport method and couple it to a photo-thermo-chemistry module to account for the interaction of ionising radiation with the Hydrogen gas, and benchmark it using tests for radiative transfer models comparison in astrophysics as defined in arXiv:astro-ph/0603199. We find that high order P_n (e.g. P_9) indeed correct M_1's flaws, while faring as well or even better in some aspects in the tests, in particular when directionality is important or colliding radiation fronts occur. By comparing P_9 and M_1 radiation fields in an idealised and cosmological test case, we highlight a new, thus far unreported artefact of M_1, the 'dark sombrero'. A dark sombrero appears as a spherical photon-deficit shell around the source. The photon density in dark sombreros can be underestimated by a factor up to 2-3. They occur in regions where a source's radiation field connects with that of another source or group of sources. These basic properties (position and amplitude) of the dark sombreros may depend on the sources' relative intensities, positions, spatial resolution, although we have not been able to test this in detail in this study.
#### Testing Dark Matter with Generative Models for Extragalactic Stellar Streams

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming ground and space-based surveys are poised to illuminate low surface brightness tidal features, providing a new observable connection to dark matter physics. From imaging of tidal debris, the morphology of stellar streams can be used to infer the geometry of dark matter halos. In this paper, we develop a generative approach, X-Stream, which translates stream imaging into constraints on the radial density profile of dark matter halos--from the inner region out to the virial radius. Using the GPU-accelerated code streamsculptor, we generate thousands of stream realizations in trial gravitational potentials and apply nested sampling with a custom objective function to explore viable regions of parameter space. We find that multiple stellar streams can be used to constrain the entire radial density profile of a halo, including both its inner and outer density slopes. These constraints provide a test for alternatives to cold dark matter, such as self-interacting dark matter, which predicts cored density profiles. From cosmological simulations, the outer density slope is expected to correlate with merger histories though remains underexplored observationally. With ongoing and upcoming missions such as Euclid, the Rubin Observatory, ARRAKIHS, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, X-Stream will enable detailed mapping of dark matter for thousands of galaxies across a wide range of redshifts and halo masses.
