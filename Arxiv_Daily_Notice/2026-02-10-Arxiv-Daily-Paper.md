 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation feedback may heat and remove gas from galaxies in a process that quenches ongoing star formation and shapes the evolution of galaxies. Potential impacts from these processes can be seen in the complex and interconnected signatures of AGN and star formation activity throughout a galaxy. Here, we analyze archival integral field unit (IFU) data for the nearby Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365, as observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Our analysis probes the ionization and kinematic properties of NGC 1365 at high spatial resolution over unprecedentedly large physical scales (approximately 40 kpc), allowing us to trace the effects of feedback throughout nearly an entire galaxy. We use these optical IFU data in conjunction with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze and compare maps of emission line flux, ionization state, star formation, and gas kinematics. In doing so, we identify a region of BPT-identified unexpectedly high ionization relative to surrounding areas in the star forming arms, and work to identify its source, finding that shock heating may play a significant role. Results from this analysis allow us to place constraints on the relative impact of AGN and star formation processes on the star forming gas in NGC 1365, as well as begin to inform our understanding on the global impacts of feedback in galaxy populations as a whole.
#### The stellar velocity anisotropy of strong lensing massive elliptical galaxies and its role in the inference of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ using spatially resolved kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 One of the biggest challenges in cosmology, the Hubble Tension, requires independent measurements of $H_0$, and strong lensing with time-delay cosmography is a promising avenue. The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass--sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $\beta$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in $H_{0}$ across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: $+0.2 \pm 1.6\%$ (ML), $-0.9 \pm 1.9\%$ (constant) and $-0.9 \pm 1.6\%$ (gOM), with $\sim 5\%$ scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, $H_{0}$ errors can exceed $20\%$, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of $+11.5 \pm 1.3\%$ (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies. Our findings highlight the impact of anisotropy assumptions on $H_{0}$ inference and, more broadly, in galaxy dynamics.
#### Clump-Scale Dust Attenuation in Epoch of Reionization Galaxies: Spatially Resolved Properties from FirstLight Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding dust attenuation in galaxies at both integrated and spatially resolved scales is fundamental for accurately determining the physical properties of galaxies. Recent high-spatial-resolution observations with ALMA and JWST enable investigations of spatially resolved properties in high-redshift galaxies ($z \gtrsim 6$), but spatial variations in dust properties remain poorly constrained. We use cosmological zoom-in simulations combined with post-processing dust radiative transfer calculations for 376 clumpy galaxies at $z=6$-$9$ with stellar masses of $M_* \gtrsim 10^9 \, M_\odot$. For each system, we investigate dust attenuation and re-emission properties for three components: system-integrated, individual clumps, and diffuse regions. We find that system-integrated attenuation curves are grayer than the Calzetti curve, even when assuming MW- or SMC-type dust. Attenuation curves of individual clumps are even grayer, while diffuse regions exhibit steeper curves owing to enhanced scattering in optically thin environments. Since the effects of optical depth and dust-star geometry are intrinsically degenerate in attenuation curves, we introduce a toy model based on the IRX-$\Delta\beta$ plane, where $\Delta\beta$ denotes the difference between attenuated and intrinsic UV slopes. Applying this framework, we find that clumps have dust column densities approximately an order of magnitude higher than system-integrated values and exhibit co-spatial or dust-extended geometries. In contrast, system-integrated attenuation reflects star-extended geometries driven by contributions from optically thin diffuse regions. We apply this framework to REBELS-IFU galaxies at $z \sim 7$ and find good agreement with our simulation predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength study of nuclear outflows in the nearby dwarf Seyfert galaxy NGC~4395, which hosts an intermediate-mass black hole. Using \textit{JWST}/NIRSpec and MIRI IFU spectroscopy (1.66--28.6~$\mu$m), together with ALMA and Gemini/GMOS data, we probe the ionised and molecular gas on parsec scales. The JWST nuclear spectra reveal 134 emission lines, including H\,\textsc{i}, He, numerous fine-structure lines, H$_2$ rotational/ro-vibrational transitions, and several PAH bands. Modelling of the H$_2$ rotational lines reveals three warm/hot molecular components ($T\!\approx\!580$, 1480, and 2900~K), along with a cold ($<50$~K) phase traced by ALMA CO(2--1). Outflow signatures are detected in cold and warm/hot molecular gas, in H\,\textsc{i}, and in 36 fine-structure lines spanning ionisation potentials of 7.6--300~eV. Ionised outflow velocities range from 127 to 716~km\,s$^{-1}$, with blueshifted and redshifted components consistent with a stratified biconical geometry. The cold molecular gas shows a mass outflow rate nearly 1--2 orders of magnitude larger than that of the warm/hot molecular and ionised phases. The kinetic coupling efficiency is 0.003--0.12\% for the coronal-line gas and 0.4--1.4\% for the H\,\textsc{i} outflow, indicating that only the low-ionisation gas significantly impacts the surrounding ISM. Outflow velocity and the fraction of flux in the outflowing component increase with ionisation potential, implying that the most highly ionised gas originates closest to the AGN and is most efficiently accelerated.
