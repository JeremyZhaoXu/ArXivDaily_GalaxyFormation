 - **Abstract**
 We performed a systematic analysis of how the orbital configuration of a merger can influence the structural formation of remnant galaxies using 531 merger pairs selected from IllustrisTNG-100. We comprehensively described the merger orbital configuration, considering the relative orbital motion of the merger pair and their disk orientations. We quantified the galaxy structures by dynamically defining four components: bulge, disk, warm component, and hot inner stellar halo. For mergers on spiral-in orbits, the disk planes of the two merging galaxies tend to be aligned with the orbital plane, leading to higher fractions for the disk and warm components, as well as lower fractions for the bulge and hot inner stellar halo components in the remnant galaxy. For mergers on direct collision orbits, the disk planes of the two galaxies tend to be perpendicular to the orbital plane, leading to lower fractions for disk and warm components, as well as higher fractions of the bulge and hot inner stellar halo in the remnant. Mergers can lead to either an increase or decrease in the disk and bulge mass fraction in the remnant compared to the progenitor galaxy, depending on the merger orbital configurations; however, in 93% of cases, mergers cause an increase in the hot inner stellar halo. As a result, the luminosity fraction of the hot inner stellar halo (but not the bulge) in galaxies at $z=0$ is highly correlated with its total ex situ stellar mass. In addition, we find that merger on spiral-in orbits is one of the possible reasons for the formation of recently discovered red but HI-rich (RR) galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Spatially resolved multi-wavelength analysis is essential to study galaxy formation and evolution. A UV-bright galaxy COS-2987030247 at $z = 6.81$ is one of the Rosetta Stones in the epoch of reionization for which JWST NIRSpec Integral Field Spectroscopy, NIRCam imaging, and ALMA data are available thanks to the RIOJA program. We identified the rest-frame optical emission lines from the ionized hydrogen, oxygen, and neon gas. The [OIII] 5008Å line emission and the NIRCam images show a complex kinematical and morphological structure where two bright main and three faint clumps are identified in a 10 kpc extent. The system is not a simple rotating disk, but instead consists of merger-induced star-forming clumps, as expected from recent cosmological simulations. The spatially resolved emission line fluxes show that dust attenuation, metal enrichment, and ionization parameter are preferentially enhanced in the star formation peaks. Our SED fitting suggests that the main clumps are in a moderately dust-attenuated star forming phase ($A_{\rm V} = 0.2$--$0.3$ and SFR(H$\alpha$) $\sim 10$\,M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$) with almost zero escape fraction of ionizing photons. In contrast, the sub-clumps are dust-free and lying on or below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. These sub-clumps may work as a perturber that triggers the clumpy starburst in the surrounding gas through the merger event.

 - **Abstract**
 The vast amount of energy released by active galactic nuclei (AGN) is increasingly recognized as a key driver of evolution not only in massive galaxies and clusters, but also in low-mass dwarf galaxies. Despite this, their role in the early stages of galaxy formation and in self-regulating the rapid growth of the first and abundant supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains poorly understood. Through new high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations, we follow the co-evolution of $10^5 M_\odot$ black hole seeds with their host galaxy. The simulated suite progressively spans physics ranging from no AGN feedback and Eddington-limited thermal feedback, to more complex setups including non-Eddington-limited thermal, kinetic and radiative feedback. Across all our models, we find that black hole seeds efficiently reach masses of $\sim10^7 M_\odot$ by z=8. Although they exhibit notably different mass growth histories, these latter seem unimpeded by the presence of AGN feedback. The simulation including radiative feedback is the most distinct, with super-Eddington episodes driving fast and mass-loaded gas outflows (exceeding 2500 km $s^{-1}$) up to $\sim$50 kpc, along with minor stellar mass suppression in the host galaxy. Our measurements are in broad agreement with moderate luminosity quasars recently observed by JWST, producing overmassive black holes, dynamical masses of $\sim10^{9.5} M_\odot$, and high, though short-lived, Eddington fraction accretion rates. These results advocate for a scenario where AGN feedback allows for rapid SMBH growth during the reionisation era, while driving winds that extend deep into the intergalactic medium - shaping host galaxies as well as more distant surroundings.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a robust, apples-to-apples comparison between the photometric properties of the intracluster light (ICL) in the TNG300 magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulation and those in Wendelstein Wide Field Imager (WWFI) observations. This is accomplished by generating synthetic $g'$-band images of 40 massive ($\log\left(M_{\rm 200, crit}/{\rm M}_{\odot}\right) > 14.5$) TNG300 clusters at $z \approx 0.06$, closely mimicking WWFI observations, and then performing identical photometric calculations on the synthetic and real images. Importantly, we apply the same observationally motivated satellite-masking procedure to both data-sets, which effectively removes any possible biases introduced by the halo finder. We first analyze the light distribution of the `smooth' stellar component of each cluster, composed of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) plus the ICL, and find that it tends to be about twice as extended in TNG300 than in observations, while also being approximately 1 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ brighter. We then quantify $f_{\rm ICL}$, the ICL fraction relative to the BCG+ICL, by considering several ICL definitions: (i) the light dimmer than a surface brightness cut at 27 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, (ii) the excess light over a de Vaucouleurs profile, (iii) the light beyond twice the half-light radius ($2 r_{\rm half}$), and (iv) the light beyond a fixed circular aperture of 30, 50, or 100 kpc. For most definitions, the median $f_{\rm ICL}$ is consistent between simulation and observations. However, the observations exhibit larger scatter in $f_{\rm ICL}$, which we attribute primarily to observational uncertainties in the total BCG+ICL luminosity rather than `true' cluster-to-cluster variation in the real Universe. We also find that most methods yield median $f_{\rm ICL}$ values near 0.3, which is consistent with a BCG/ICL transition radius around $2 r_{\rm half}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has so far observed three classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor. Based on the observed line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of their member stars, we apply the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion modeling (JAM) approach to recover their inner dark matter distributions. In particular, both the traditional single-population Jeans model and the multiple population chemodynamical model are adopted. With the chemodynamical model, we divide member stars of each dSph into metal-rich and metal-poor populations. The metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated and dynamically colder, featuring lower velocity dispersion profiles than the metal-poor populations. We find a diversity of the inner density slopes $\gamma$ of dark matter halos, with the best constraints by single-population or chemodynamical models consistent with each other. The inner density slopes are $0.71^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$, $0.26^{+0.22}_{-0.12}$ and $0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor, respectively. We also present the measured astrophysical J and D factors of the three dSphs. Our results indicate that the study of the dark matter content of dSphs through stellar kinematics is still subject to uncertainties behind both the methodology and the observed data, through comparisons with previous measurements and data sets.
#### On the width and profiles of cosmic filaments

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the widths and profiles of cosmic filaments using the IllustrisTNG simulations. Filaments were identified with DisPerSE, using galaxy samples in simulations as input. Since the width of an individual filament can vary significantly along its spine, we divided each filament into segments with lengths between $1.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $2.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and measure their properties. The typical width of these filament segments increases gradually from approximately $0.3\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at redshift $z = 2.0$ to about $1.0-1.5\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $z = 0.0$. We find that the segment width correlates nearly linearly with the linear halo mass density, consistent with previous studies. A similar linear relation is observed between the segment width and the linear stellar mass density, providing a potential estimator for filament width. Furthermore, the density profiles of filaments with different widths exhibit self-similarity and can be described by a unified formula akin to the isothermal $\beta$-model. For segments with a given width, the rescaled density profiles show only mild evolution from $z = 2.0$ to $z = 0.0$. Within the filament width, the gas temperature decreases slowly from the center to the boundary, with thicker filaments generally containing hotter gas than thinner ones. These trends in filament width, density, and thermal profiles are consistently observed across the TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300 simulations, and align well with results from earlier studies. We briefly discuss the potential implications and applications of our findings.

 - **Abstract**
 Early multi-wavelength observations offer crucial insights into the nature of the relativistic jets responsible for gamma-ray bursts and their interaction with the surrounding this http URL present data of GRB 240825A from 17 space- and ground-based telescopes/instruments, covering wavelengths from NIR/optical to X-ray and GeV, and spanning from the prompt emission to the afterglow phase triggered by Swift and Fermi. The early afterglow observations were carried out by SVOM/C-GFT, and spectroscopic observations of the afterglow by GTC, VLT, and TNG determined the redshift of the burst ($z = 0.659$) later.A comprehensive analysis of the prompt emission spectrum observed by Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM/LAT reveals a rare and significant high-energy cutoff at ~76 MeV. Assuming this cutoff is due to $\gamma\gamma$ absorption allows us to place an upper limit on the initial Lorentz factor, $\Gamma_0 < 245$. The optical/NIR and GeV afterglow light curves be described by the standard external shock model, with early-time emission dominated by a reverse shock (RS) and a subsequent transition to forward shock (FS) emission. Our afterglow modelling yields a consistent estimate of the initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{\rm 0} \sim 234$). Furthermore, the RS-to-FS magnetic field ratio ($\mathcal{R}_B \sim 302$) indicates that the reverse shock region is significantly more magnetized than the FS region. An isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of $E_{\text{k,iso}} = 5.25 \times 10^{54}$ erg is derived, and the corresponding $\gamma$-ray radiation efficiency is estimated to be $\eta_{\gamma}$ = 3.1%. On the other hand, the standard afterglow model can not reproduce the X-ray light curve of GRB 240825A, calling for improved models to characterize all multi-wavelength data.
