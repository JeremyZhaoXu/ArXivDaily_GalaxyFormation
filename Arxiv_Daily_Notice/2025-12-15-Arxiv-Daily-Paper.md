 - **Abstract**
 We quantify departures from hydrodynamical and centrifugal equilibrium in the gas discs of low-mass ($10^{10.75}<M_\mathrm{200c}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{11}$) galaxies from the COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We evaluate the full Eulerian acceleration balance in the midplane and show that disequilibrium is widespread: equilibrium-based circular velocity estimates typically have errors of $\geq 10$ per cent ($\approx 75$ per cent of midplane gas by mass). Disequilibrium is strongest and the largest associated errors occur in the inner few kiloparsecs that are crucial for constraining the dark matter density profile. Correcting the circular velocity to account for pressure and convective terms does not reliably improve its recovery in strongly perturbed systems where time-dependent forces dominate the residual acceleration budget. Stellar feedback, self-gravitating gas clumps and AGN energy injection account for most strong local perturbations, and large-scale gravitational asymmetries act as a scaffold for disequilibrium. We classify gas discs into coherent, perturbed, and slow/erratic rotators and show that this classification correlates with galaxy properties like mass, morphology and tracers of recent feedback. A majority of galaxies in our sample would be unsuitable for standard rotation curve analysis. Much of the observed diversity in the shapes of dwarf galaxy rotation curves may stem from non-equilibrium gas motions rather than diversity in mass profiles - resolving the discrepancy is then first and foremost a problem in gas dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the prevalence of thin galaxies as a function of stellar mass in the range $10^7<M_{\star}/\rm{M_\odot}<10^{11}$ using data from the GAMA, DESI, ALFALFA and Nearby Galaxy catalogs. We use the distribution of projected axis ratios, $q$, to infer the abundance of intrinsically flat galaxies needed to reproduce the observed abundance of highly elongated systems in projection. We find that as many as $40\%$ of galaxies in the mass range $10^9<M_{\star}/\rm{M_\odot}<10^{10}$ are intrinsically flatter than $1$:$5$ (i.e., $c/a<0.2$), a fraction that rises to $\sim 80\%$ for $c/a<0.3$. Although the incidence of thin galaxies decreases towards lower and higher $M_{\star}$, they are still quite common in dwarfs: $\sim 30\%$ and $\sim 65\%$ of $\sim 10^8 ~ \rm{M_\odot}$ galaxies are inferred to be intrinsically flatter than $c/a=0.2$ and $0.3$, respectively. A comparison of these results with several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (TNG50, FIREbox, Romulus25) reveals a distinctive lack of thin simulated dwarfs. In particular, there are no $M_{\star} < 10^9 ~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ simulated galaxies flatter than $c/a=0.2$, in clear contrast with observational samples. This discrepancy likely reflects limitations in resolution and in the treatment of baryonic physics, suggesting that our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the formation of disk galaxies less massive than the Milky Way is still quite incomplete. Our results present a clear challenge to current numerical models of dwarf galaxy formation, which future models should attempt to meet.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the dynamics of Intermediate-Mass Black Hole (IMBH) binaries within Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs) that contain a population of stellar-mass black holes (BHs). We examine how these stellar and BH populations influence the dynamics of the IMBH binary and, in turn, how the evolving IMBH binary affects the surrounding stellar and BH populations. We conduct high-resolution $N$-body simulations of NSCs constructed based on observational parameters from two local dwarf galaxies: NGC205 and NGC404. For the first time, we achieve a star particle mass resolution of $1\rm\;M_{\odot}$ and a BH mass resolution of $10\rm\;M_{\odot}$. This level of resolution is crucial for accurately modeling the collisional dynamics of these dense systems. Including stellar-mass BHs within the stellar population significantly influences the IMBH binary dynamics, nearly doubling the sinking rate and halving the merger time. During the initial phase of the inspiral, the IMBH binary disrupts both the stellar and BH cusps. However, the BH cusp quickly regains its steep slope due to its shorter relaxation time and continues to dominate the evolution of the IMBH binary, despite being much less massive compared to the stellar component. We uncover an interesting mechanism in which BHs first efficiently extract energy from the IMBH binary and then transfer this energy to the surrounding stars, allowing the BHs to spiral back toward the center of the system and restart the process. Our results imply that, although stellar mass BHs are a minor component of a stellar population, they can significantly facilitate IMBH growth within NSCs via mergers. We also notice that these dense systems can potentially boost Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals (IMRIs) predominantly on radial orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper reports recent discoveries from the Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) survey, which aims to uncover pulsars in the globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). Utilising the Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) and Band-3 (300$-$500 MHz) receivers, the survey targets GCs accessible to uGMRT ($-53^\circ\,<\,\delta\,<\,-17^\circ$), excluding the declination range that can be covered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The survey focuses on GCs that have not previously been searched with comparable sensitivity in these radio frequencies. In this paper, we present the discovery of the five MSPs in two GCs, $-$ NGC~6637 (M69) and NGC~6681 (M70), each hosting MSPs identified here for the first time. Observations of M69 led to the discovery of two MSPs: J1831$-$3220A (M69A) and J1831$-$3220B (M69B), both of which we localize with arcsecond precision using interferometric imaging. Observations of M70 resulted in three new MSPs: J1843$-$3217A (M70A), J1843$-$3217B (M70B), and J1843$-$3217C (M70C). Although direct imaging did not yield precise localizations for these MSPs, we provide initial estimates based on uGMRT beam forming and imaging analysis. Additionally, we present preliminary imaging results for other observed GCs, and in cases of non-detections, we report upper limits on pulsed emission based on the rms noise levels in the image plane.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel self-consistent theoretical framework to characterize the formation, evolution, and merger sites of dynamically-formed black hole binaries, with a focus on explaining the most massive events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5. This cosmic evolution is a crucial signature with significant implications for future detectors like the LISA, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, which will be capable to probe the high-redshift Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide energetic feedback necessary to `turn off' star formation in high-mass galaxies (M$_{\rm halo} \geq $ 10$^{12.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, $10.4 \leq \log(\frac{M_*}{M_\odot}) \leq 11$) as observed. Cosmic rays (CRs) have been proposed as a promising channel of AGN feedback, but the nature of CR feedback from AGN remains uncertain. We analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of massive galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-3) project including multi-channel AGN feedback, explicitly evolving kinetic/mechanical, radiative, and spectrally-resolved CRs from the central black hole. Specifically, we explore different CR feedback and transport assumptions, calibrated to Milky Way local ISM constraints, and compare them to observed galaxy scaling relations. We find that all parameterizations explored self-regulate within agreement with observed galaxy scaling relations, demonstrating that CR injection efficiencies varied by $\sim$1.5 dex and locally-variable transport produce quenched galaxies with reasonable bulk properties; however, they feature orders-of-magnitude variant circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas properties. Our results indicate that multi-wavelength synthetic observations probing these varied halo properties from larger simulated samples in conjunction with observational comparisons may place novel constraints on how AGN physically quench star formation in massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of 189 dwarf galaxies and their globular cluster (GC) systems in the Perseus cluster, based on deep Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging and Keck spectroscopy, supplemented by literature data. This constitutes the largest sample of dwarfs in a single galaxy cluster to date with simultaneous deep imaging, spectroscopic coverage, and GC measurements, while uniquely spanning a broad and continuous range of galaxy properties. We find an anti-correlation between GC specific mass and galaxy stellar mass for dwarfs in Perseus similar to observations in other clusters. At fixed stellar mass, dwarfs with lower surface brightness or larger effective radius tend to be more GC-rich -- suggesting either high GC formation efficiency in an earlier compact-galaxy phase, or less efficient GC disruption. The correlation between GC richness and axis ratio in Perseus is weaker than in other environments. We find some connection between GC richness and infall time, but not with the clear correlations found in Virgo, Coma, and cosmological simulations. More complete observations are needed to test for cluster-to-cluster variations in galaxy and GC evolutionary histories. This work demonstrates the potential of new wide-field imaging and spectroscopy surveys for understanding GCs and dwarf galaxies, and highlights the need for further work in theoretical modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B < 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are among the densest stellar environments in the universe. In these environments, collisions can shape the stellar mass function and produce exotic stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how stellar collisions couple with stellar evolution in the inner parsec of an NSC. We simulate the evolution of a sample of $1000$ $1$ $M_\odot$ stars embedded in a uniform cluster of dynamically relaxed 0.5 $M_\odot$ stars. Using COSMIC to evolve stellar properties in time , we track the mass, radius, and evolutionary state of the stars as they collide in the cluster. Our results show that most stars within $0.1$~pc of the SMBH experience a collision while on the main-sequence. However, outside of this distance, stars collide during the red giant phase, when the stellar radius increases dramatically. We find that the most common type of collision -- main-sequence or red giant -- over the lifetime of the cluster depends on the steepness of the stellar cusp, which determines the spatial distribution of the stars in the cluster. These results show that stellar evolution plays a fundamental role in shaping the collisional history of stars in nuclear star clusters. Lastly, we consider whether the closest known stars to the Milky Way's SMBH have experienced a collision. We estimate that several of the S-stars have a high probability of experiencing a collision over their main-sequence lifetime, perhaps with implications for their observed youth and properties.
#### Kennicutt-Schmidt relation of galaxies over 13 billion years in the COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) surface density and gas surface density (known as the Kennicutt-Schmidt, KS, relation) at kiloparsec (kpc) scales across cosmic time ($0\le z \le 8$) using the COLIBRE state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. These simulations feature on-the-fly non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to dust grain evolution and detailed radiative cooling down to $\approx 10$~K, enabling direct predictions for the atomic (HI) and molecular (H$_2$) KS relations. At $z\approx 0$, COLIBRE reproduces the observed (spatially-resolved) KS relations for HI and H$_2$, including the associated scatter, which we predict to be significantly correlated with stellar surface density, local specific SFR (sSFR), and gas metallicity. We show that the HI KS relation steepens for lower-mass galaxies, while the H$_2$ KS relation shifts to higher normalisation in galaxies with higher sSFRs. The H$_2$ depletion time decreases by a factor of $\approx 20$ from $z = 0$ to $z = 8$, primarily due to the decreasing gas-phase metallicity. This results in less H$_2$ and more HI being associated with a given SFR at higher redshift. We also find that galaxies with higher sSFRs have a larger molecular gas content and higher star formation efficiency per unit gas mass on kpc scales. The predicted evolution of the H$_2$ depletion time and its correlation with a galaxy's sSFR agree remarkably well with observations in a wide redshift range, $0\le z\le 5$.
#### The low-mass and structured stellar halo of M83 argues against a merger origin for its starburst and extended neutral hydrogen disk

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11744

 - **Abstract**
 A merger origin has been suggested for M83's massive, metal-rich extended HI disk and nuclear starburst. We observe M83's stellar halo to test this idea. We train nearest-neighbor star-galaxy separation on wide-area Subaru imaging with Hubble Space Telescope data to map M83's halo in resolved stars. We find that M83 has an extended, very low density smooth stellar halo of old and metal-poor [M/H]$\sim -1.15$ RGB stars with a mass between 15 and 40 kpc of $\log_{10}M_{*,15-40,maj}/M_{\odot}=8.02\pm0.10$. In addition to M83's well-known Northern Stream, our ground-based Subaru imaging reveals a new stream to M83's south, which modeling suggests could be its trailing arm. The combined stream masses are $\log_{10}M_{stream}/M_{\odot}=7.93\pm0.10$, with metallicity [M/H]$= -1.0\pm0.2$. The stream progenitor was only recently accreted, as its stellar populations suggest that it formed stars until $2.1\pm1.3$ Gyr ago. M83 lies on the stellar halo mass-metallicity correlation seen for other Milky Way mass galaxies, albeit with low stellar halo mass. We infer a total accreted mass of $\log_{10}M_{*,accreted}/M_{\odot}=8.78^{+0.22}_{-0.28}$, with the most massive past merger having $\log_{10}M_{*,dom}/M_{\odot}=8.5\pm0.3$. We identify plausible M83 analogs in TNG-50 with similar stellar halos, finding that while a recent accretion can create a prominent stellar stream, such accretions do not trigger starburst activity, nor do they deliver enough gas to form M83's extended Hi disk. We conclude that other non-merger mechanisms, such as secular evolution or accretion of gas from the IGM, are likely to be responsible for M83's remarkable properties.
#### The Effect of a Non-universal Extinction Curve on the Wesenheit Function and Cepheid Distances

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11758

 - **Abstract**
 The Wesenheit function is widely used to reduce the effects of interstellar reddening in distance measurements. Its construction, however, relies on the assumption of a universal extinction curve and on fixed values of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv. Recent studies have shown that Rv varies significantly across the Milky Way and between different galaxies, raising concerns about systematic biases in Wesenheit magnitudes and period-Wesenheit relations. In this work, we discuss the impact of non-universal extinction on Wesenheit indices by combining the Rv-dependent extinction curve with a grid of stellar atmosphere models. We compute the integrated extinction in optical and near-infrared passbands, derive Rv-dependent R coefficients for multiple Wesenheit indices, and examine how changes in Rv propagate into Wesenheit magnitudes and Cepheid distances in our Galaxy. We find that the R coefficients in the Wesenheit functions vary strongly with Rv. For classical Cepheids in the Milky Way disk, variations of Rv within the typical observed range (2.6-3.6) can lead to substantial differences in the Wesenheit function, reaching +-0.7 mag from the mean for the Gaia-based Wesenheit index W_G and resulting in distance errors of almost 40%. Near-infrared Wesenheit indices are much less sensitive to Rv changes. Our results clearly show that accounting for variable Rv is essential when applying period-Wesenheit relations, particularly in the optical regime, or that near or mid infrared based distances should be used. While we present this effect for classical Cepheids, it applies to all pulsating stars for which period-Wesenheit relations are used to infer distances.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold dark matter (CDM) evolves as a collisionless fluid under the Vlasov-Poisson equations, but N-body simulations approximate this evolution by discretising the distribution function into particles, introducing discreteness effects at small scales. We present a physics-informed neural network approach that evolves CDM fields without any use of N-body data or methods, using a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to model the continuous displacement field for one-dimensional halo collapse. Physical constraints derived from the Vlasov-Poisson equations are embedded directly into the loss function, enabling accurate evolution beyond the first shell crossing. The trained model achieves sub-percent errors on the residuals even after seven shell crossings and matches N-body results while providing a resolution-free representation of the displacement field. In addition, displacement errors do not grow over time, a very interesting feature with respect to N-body methods. It can also reconstruct initial conditions through backward evolution when sufficient final-state information is available. Although current runtimes exceed those of N-body methods, this framework offers a new route to high-fidelity CDM evolution without particle discretisation, with prospects for extension to higher dimensions.
