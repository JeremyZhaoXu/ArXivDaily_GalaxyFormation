 - **Abstract**
 The caustic skeleton model is a mathematically rigorous framework for studying the formation history of the emerging cosmic web from the caustics in the underlying dark matter flow. In a series of two papers, we use constrained N-body simulations to investigate the different cosmic web environments. For the current study, we focus on the cosmic walls. We derive the conditions of the centres of proto-walls and analyse their evolution with N-body simulations. Next, we investigate the statistical properties of Zel'dovich pancakes by studying the number density of the cosmic wall centres in scale space and, for the first time, we calculate the Lagrangian-space volume of cosmic walls. Finally, we infer the mean density and velocity fields and the distribution of haloes around cosmic walls with a suite of physically realistic dark-matter-only simulations. We compare the cosmic walls obtained with the caustic skeleton framework with previously proposed saddle point conditions on the primordial potential and density perturbation.

 - **Abstract**
 The extremely-low-luminosity, compact Milky Way satellite Ursa Major III / UNIONS 1 (UMaIII/U1; $L_V = 11 \ L_{\odot}$; $a_{1/2} = 3$ pc) was found to have a substantial velocity dispersion at the time of its discovery ($\sigma_v = 3.7^{+1.4}_{-1.0} \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$), suggesting that it might be an exceptional, highly dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy with very few stars. However, significant questions remained about the system's dark matter content and nature as a dwarf galaxy due to the small member sample ($N=11$), possible spectroscopic binaries, and the lack of any metallicity information. Here, we present new spectroscopic observations covering $N=16$ members that both dynamically and chemically test UMaIII/U1's true nature. From higher-precision Keck/DEIMOS spectra, we find a 95% confidence level velocity dispersion limit of $\sigma_v< 2.3 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$, with a $\sim$120:1 likelihood ratio now favoring the expected stellar-only dispersion of $\sigma_* \approx 0.1 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ over the original $3.7 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ dispersion. There is now no observational evidence for dark matter in the system. From Keck/LRIS spectra targeting the Calcium II K line, we also measure the first metallicities for 12 member stars, finding a mean metallicity of $\rm [Fe/H] = -2.65 \; \pm \, 0.1$ (stat.) $\pm \,0.3$ (zeropoint) with a metallicity dispersion limit of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} < 0.35$ dex (at the 95% credible level). Together, these properties are more consistent with UMaIII/U1 being a star cluster, though the dwarf galaxy scenario is not fully ruled out. Under this interpretation, UMaIII/U1 ranks among the most metal-poor star clusters yet discovered and is potentially the first known example of a cluster stabilized by a substantial population of unseen stellar remnants.
#### Analysis of the plane of satellites around Milky Way-like galaxies in $Λ$CDM cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested that the Plane of Satellites (PoS) phenomenon may imply a tension with current $\Lambda$CDM cosmology since a Milky-Way (MW)-like PoS is very rare in simulations. In this study, we analyze a large sample of satellite systems of MW-like galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations. We analyze their spatial aspect ratio, orbital pole dispersion, Gini coefficient, radial distribution, and bulk satellite velocity relative to the host galaxy. These are compared to the observed Milky~Way PoS. We identified galaxy samples in two mass ranges ($0.1 - 0.8 \times 10^{12} $ M$_\odot$ and $0.8 - 3.0 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$). We find for both mass ranges that only $\sim$ 1 percent of MW-like galaxies contain a PoS similar to that of the MW. Nevertheless, these outliers occur naturally in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We analyze the formation, environment, and evolution of the PoS for nine systems that are most MW-like. We suggest that a PoS can form from one or more of at least five different processes. A massive Magellanic~Cloud (MC)-like satellite is found in 1/3 of the systems and probably plays an important role in the PoS formation. We find a tendency for about half of the satellites to have recently arrived at $z < 0.5$, indicating that a MW-like PoS is a recent and transient phenomenon. We also find that a spin up of the angular momentum amplitude of the most massive satellites is an indicator of the recent in-fall of the PoS satellites.
#### Gravitational lensing by a spiral galaxy I: the influence from bar's structure to the flux ratio anomaly

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lens flux ratio anomalies are a powerful probe of small-scale mass structures within lens galaxies. These anomalies are often attributed to dark matter subhalos, but the baryonic components of the lens can also play a significant role. This study investigates the impact of galactic bars, a common feature in spiral galaxies, on flux ratio anomalies. We conduct a systematic analysis using a sample of 21 barred galaxies from the high-resolution Auriga cosmological simulations. First, we model the projected mass distribution of these galaxies with the Multi-Gaussian Expansion formalism. This method yields smooth lens potentials that preserve the primary bar structure while mitigating numerical noise. We then perform strong lensing simulations and quantify the flux ratio anomalies by measuring their deviation from the theoretical cusp-caustic relation. To characterize the structural properties of the bars, we use a Fourier decomposition of the surface mass density in the bar region. Our primary finding is a strong, statistically significant correlation between the magnitude of the flux ratio anomaly and the strength of higher-order even Fourier modes. Specifically, the strengths of the boxy/peanut and hexapole components show an exceptionally tight correlation with the flux anomaly, with Spearman correlation coefficients of r=0.85 and 0.89, and p-values on the order of 1e-6 and 1e-8, respectively. This demonstrates that flux ratio anomalies are highly sensitive to the complex, non-axisymmetric features of galactic bars. We conclude that the flux ratio anomaly can be a powerful indicator of a galactic bar's complex morphology. Failing to account for a bar's complex morphology can lead to a misinterpretation of the lensing signature, potentially causing an overestimation of the dark matter subhalo population.
#### Accelerating cosmological simulations on GPUs: a portable approach using OpenMP

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we present the porting to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs, using OpenMP target directives) and optimization of a key module within the cosmological {\pinocchio} code, a Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT)-based framework widely used for generating dark matter (DM) halo catalogs. Our optimization focuses on a specific segment of the code responsible for calculating the collapse time of each particle involved in the simulation. Due to the embarrassingly parallel nature of this computation, it represents an ideal candidate for GPU offloading. As part of the porting process, we developed fully GPU-native implementations of both cubic spline and bilinear interpolation routines, required for evaluating collapse times. Since GNU Scientific Library (GSL) does not support GPU offloading, these custom implementations run entirely on the GPU and achieve residuals of only $\sim0.003\%$ when compared to the CPU-based implementation of GSL. Comparative benchmarking on the LEONARDO (NVIDIA-based) and SETONIX (AMD-based) supercomputers reveals notable portability and performance, with speedups of~\textit{4x} and up to~\textit{8x}, respectively. While collapse time calculation is not a primary bottleneck in the overall workflow, the acceleration reduces full production runs by $\sim 100$ seconds each leading to a cumulative saving of $\sim 160000$ Standard-h ($\sim28$ hours wall time) across thousands of simulations. Roofline analysis confirms that our GPU porting achieves over 80\% of the theoretical FP64 peak performance, confirming efficient compute-bound execution. This work demonstrates that OpenMP directives offer a portable, effective strategy for accelerating large-scale cosmological simulations on heterogeneous hardware.

 - **Abstract**
 Low metallicity stellar populations are very abundant in the Universe, either as the remnants of the past history of the Milky Way or similar spiral galaxies, or the young low metallicity stellar populations that are being observed in the local dwarf galaxies or in the high-z objects with low metal content recently found with JWST. Our goal is to develop new high-spectral-resolution models tailored for low-metallicity environments and apply them to analyse stellar population data, particularly in cases where a significant portion of the stellar content exhibits low metallicity. Methods. We used the state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis code HR-pyPopStar with available stellar libraries to create a new set of models focused on low metallicity stellar populations. We have compared the new spectral energy distributions with the previous models of HR-pyPopStar for solar metallicity. Once we verified that the spectra, except for the oldest ages that show some differences in the molecular bands of the TiO and G band, are similar, we reanalysed the high resolution data from the globular cluster M 15 by finding a better estimate of its age and metallicity. Finally, we analysed a subsample of mostly star-forming dwarf galaxies from the MaNGA survey we found similar stellar mass-mean stellar metallicity weighted by light to other studies that studied star forming dwarf galaxies and slightly higher mean stellar metallicity than the other works that analysed all types of dwarf galaxies at the same time, but are within error bars.
#### Rapid onset of a Comptonisation zone in the repeating tidal disruption event XMMSL2 J140446.9-251135

 - **Abstract**
 We report here on observations of a tidal disruption event, XMMSL2 J1404-2511, discovered in an XMM-Newton slew, in a quiescent galaxy at z=0.043. X-ray monitoring covered the epoch when the accretion disc transitioned from a thermal state, with kT~80 eV, to a harder state dominated by a warm, optically-thick corona. The bulk of the coronal formation took place within 7 days and was coincident with a temporary drop in the emitted radiation by a factor 4. After a plateau phase of ~100 days, the X-ray flux of XMMSL2 J1404-2511 decayed by a factor 500 within 230 days. We estimate the black hole mass in the galaxy to be $M_{BH}=4\pm{2}\times10^{6}$ solar masses and the peak X-ray luminosity $L_{X}\sim6\times10^{43}$ ergs/s. The optical/UV light curve is flat over the timescale of the observations with $L_{opt}\sim 2\times10^{41}$ ergs/s. We find that TDEs with coronae are more often found in an X-ray sample than in an optically-selected sample. Late-time monitoring of the optical sample is needed to test whether this is an intrinsic property of TDEs or is due to a selection effect. From the fast decay of the X-ray emission we consider that the event was likely due to the partial stripping of an evolved star rather than a full stellar disruption, an idea supported by the detection of two further re-brightening episodes, two and four years after the first event, in the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey.
#### Photometric Analysis of 30 Contact Binaries in M31

 - **Abstract**
 M31, as the largest galaxy in the Local Group, is of significant importance for the study of stellar formation and evolution. Based on the data of 5,859 targets observed in M31 by Gu et al (\citeyear{2024ApJS..273....9G}), we selected 30 contact binaries by visual inspection for further study. Using the PHOEBE software and employing Bayesian optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, we determined the physical parameters of these 30 systems. The results show that 10 systems exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is well explained by introducing a dark spot on the primary star. 11 systems have mass ratios below 0.15, classifying them as extremely low mass ratio contact binaries, making them promising candidates for binary mergers. Six systems have primary star temperatures exceeding 10,000 K, classifying them as early-type contact binaries. The absolute physical parameters reveal that two contact binary systems contain massive stellar components, which may eventually evolve into compact binary star systems. To compare the effects of different galactic environments on the evolution of contact binaries, we constructed evolutionary diagrams for these 30 targets and for contact binaries in the Milky Way. The results show that, at the same mass, our targets have larger radii, higher luminosities, and lower orbital angular momenta than contact binaries in the Milky Way, indicating that they are at more advanced evolutionary stages. This may be attributed to the higher metallicity in M31 compared to the Milky Way.
#### On the origin of counterrotating stellar disks in TNG50. I

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding galaxy evolution is key to explaining the structures we observe in the present-day Universe. Counterrotating stellar disks (CRDs), i.e. co-spatial stellar disks rotating with opposite angular momentum, have been proposed as signatures of past accretion events. Therefore, they constitute potentially valuable tracers of galactic assembly. We aim to investigate the properties, formation, and significance of CRDs in a sample of Milky Way mass galaxies using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We select 260 central late-type galaxies (i.e. $M_{\rm tot} \approx 10^{12}$, $D/T>0.5$, $N_{\rm star}>10^5$). For each galaxy, we measure the circularity of its stellar particles and define the CRD by considering all particles with circularity $\epsilon < -0.7$, which are located within the spatial extension of the main disk. We then characterize the mass fraction, spatial extent, and star formation history of the CRDs. Out of the 260 galaxies, we find that 26 host significant CRDs (i.e. contributing at least 1\% of the total stellar mass of the disk). This means that CRDs are rare, consistent with the results from observations. We also find that the most of the CRDs are compact (i.e. 88\%), in-situ dominated (i.e.73\%), and exhibit bursty SFHs whose peaks often coincide with external perturbations. This means that external perturbations are able to catalyze star formation, even when a majority of the CRD's star population is in-situ. Finally, we find that a variety of formation pathways can lead to CRDs, including interaction-induced in-situ bursts and smooth accretion of misaligned gas. Overall, our results suggest that CRDs are rare but diverse in origin. In most cases, their formation is linked to the accretion of retrograde gas, either through mergers or environmental inflow, suggesting that these structures are sensitive tracers of the galaxy's past accretion history.
