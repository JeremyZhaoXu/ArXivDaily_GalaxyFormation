#### Characterizing Lyman alpha emission from high-redshift galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) line from high-redshift galaxies is a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) can significantly attenuate the emergent Ly$\alpha$ line, even in the damping wing of the cross-section. However, interpreting this damping wing imprint relies on our prior knowledge of the spectrum that escapes from the galaxy and its environs into the IGM. This emergent spectrum is highly sensitive to the composition and geometry of the interstellar and circumgalactic media, and so exhibits a large galaxy to galaxy scatter. Characterizing this scatter is further complicated by non-trivial selection effects introduced by observational surveys. Here we build a flexible, empirical model for the emergent Ly$\alpha$ spectra. Our model characterizes the emergent Ly$\alpha$ luminosity, the velocity offset of the Ly$\alpha$ line with respect to the systemic redshift, and the H$\alpha$ luminosity, with multivariate probability distributions conditioned on the UV magnitude. We constrain these distributions using $z\sim5-6$ galaxy observations with VLT MUSE and JWST NIRCam, forward-modeling observational selection functions together with galaxy parameters. Our model results in Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width distributions that are a better match to (independent) Subaru observations than previous empirical models. The extended distributions of Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths and velocity offsets we obtain could facilitate Ly$\alpha$ transmission during the early stages of the EoR. We also illustrate how our model can be used to identify GN-z11-like outliers, potentially originating from merging systems. We publish fitting functions and make our model publicly available.
#### Dust and Ices in the SNR

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of dust in supernova remnants (SNRs) is confirmed by extensive infrared data from observatories such as Spitzer, Herschel, and JWST, alongside theoretical models of dust formation. This study explores the existence of dust and ices, particularly water ice via 62 {\mu}m in SNRs such as the Crab Nebula and N49, using observational data and preliminary modeling with Cloudy. Observations suggest that water ice may be present in IC 443 and possibly other remnants, though the 63 {\mu}m band could also indicate [OI] emission. Theoretical models indicate that water ice could survive under certain conditions in SNRs, with densities and temperatures analyzed. Further observations and refined simulations are needed to confirm these findings.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a parametric strong-lensing model for the galaxy cluster MACS J1931.8-2635 ($z_l = 0.35$), accompanying the detection of the spectroscopically confirmed SN Eos at $z = 5.13$ (Coulter et al. 2026). We identify 10 new multiple-image systems in recent VENUS JWST/NIRCam imaging, so that the model is constrained with a total of 19 robust multiple-image systems -- nine of which also have a spectroscopic redshift. For the point-like source corresponding to SN Eos, our model predicts a total of five images, with the observed radial image pair having a similar magnification of $\mu \simeq 25 - 30$ and a small time delay of $< 5$ days, in agreement with their simultaneous observation. According to the model, the other three predicted images arrived earlier, with time delays of $3.7 \pm 0.7$, $3.5 \pm 0.7$ and $54.0 \pm 10.8$ years prior to the two observed images, and with magnifications of $12.9 \pm 2.6$, $13.0 \pm 2.9$ and $2.2 \pm 0.4$, respectively. The absence of detections at the predicted positions, where the host galaxy's images are also visible, confirms the transient nature of the source. SN Eos and its host galaxy are studied in separate articles, and we here focus on the lens model. The final model reaches a very good $r.m.s.$ distance between model and observations of $0.44''$. We present the lens-modeling results, including newly identified systems such as a triply imaged, grand-design spiral galaxy candidate at $z \simeq 3.65_{-0.09}^{+0.04}$, and briefly discuss the potential of using high-redshift lensed SNe for cosmography.
#### Atmospheric constraints on GJ 1214 b from CRIRES+ and prospects for characterisation with ANDES

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we aim to constrain the atmospheric composition of GJ 1214 b using all available transits observed with the upgraded CRIRES+ spectrograph at the VLT by searching for the signatures of water vapour, methane, and carbon dioxide. We analysed eight CRIRES+ transit datasets covering the K band (1.90-2.45 microns) at a resolving power of R ~ 100,000. We used the SysRem algorithm to correct for telluric and stellar contributions and employed the cross-correlation technique with templates from petitRADTRANS to search for H2O, CH4, and CO2. Injection-recovery tests across a grid of metallicities (Z) and cloud-deck pressures (pc) were performed to quantify detection limits. We also generated predictions for ANDES observations using end-to-end simulated datasets with EXoPLORE. We detect no significant H2O, CH4, or CO2 signatures. Injection-recovery tests show that such non-detections exclude atmospheres with low-altitude clouds and moderate or low metallicities. CH4 yields the tightest empirical limits, with CO2 unexpectedly ruling out intermediate metallicities (~ 100xsolar) with clouds deeper due to its rapidly rising opacity in compressed, high-Z atmospheres. Our constraints are in line with either a high-Z or a high-altitude aerosol layer, in agreement with recent JWST inferences. The combined analysis of eight CRIRES+ datasets provides the most stringent high-resolution constraints on the atmospheric properties of GJ 1214 b to date. Simulations of a single transit observed with ANDES on the ELT predict modest improvements for H2O, a substantially expanded detectable region for CH4, and the strongest gains for CO2, making the latter a particularly effective tracer for characterising high-metallicity atmospheres in sub-Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the discovery of hundreds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $z\gtrsim 4-7$. A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these ``overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered ``overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8~M_\odot$ with $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations. This suggests that the global feedback mechanisms regulating the coevolution of $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios are implicitly encoded in local relations in terms of star-formation rate distribution, black hole accretion rate distribution and their active (quiescent) fractions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present imaging and spectroscopic analyses of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of ACT-CL J0123.5$-$0428, one of the most massive, highest redshift galaxy clusters detected within the survey fields of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The Chandra data are sufficient to characterize the morphology of this cluster and constrain the geometrically deprojected temperature in 2 spatial bins out to $r_{2500}$, revealing a dynamically relaxed system whose temperature drops to $kT = 1.8\pm0.6$ keV in the inner $\sim40$kpc. Within this same inner radius, the surface brightness and density of the ICM is sharply peaked, and the cooling time falls to $t_\mathrm{cool}=280^{+150}_{-120}$ Myr. A novel forward-modeling analysis of the XMM data extends imaging and spectroscopic measurements of this system out to $r_{500}$, constraining the redshift to $z=1.50\pm0.03$, with a mean temperature of $kT = 7.3\pm1.1$ keV and an emission-weighted mean metallicity of $Z/Z_\odot = 0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.25}$. We also utilize the limited optical/IR photometric coverage of the cluster to characterize the properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), which is coincident with the X-ray peak. Despite the high redshift and strong cool core, the BCG exhibits no signs of recent or ongoing star formation, suggesting AGN feedback has been acting persistently to stem star formation since $z\sim 2.5$. These measurements identify ACT-CL J0123.5$-$0428 as the highest redshift, dynamically relaxed, cool core galaxy cluster discovered to date, making it a premier target for future astrophysical and cosmological studies.
