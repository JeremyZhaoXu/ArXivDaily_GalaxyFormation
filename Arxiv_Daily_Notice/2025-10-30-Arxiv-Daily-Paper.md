 - **Abstract**
 We present the first stellar stream discovered with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, around spiral galaxy M61 (NGC 4303) in Virgo First Look imaging. The stream is narrow, radially-oriented in projection, and ~50 kpc long. It has g-band surface brightness (SB) mu_g ~ 28 AB mag arcsec^-2, color g-z ~ 1.0, and stellar mass M_* ~ 2x10^8 M_Sun. This dwarf galaxy interaction may have provoked the M61 starburst, and foreshadows the bounty of accretion features expected in the ten-year Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

 - **Abstract**
 We combine deep photometric data in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields with high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to explore two key questions: (1) how does the galaxy stellar mass function, particularly in the dwarf (Mstar < 10^9.5 MSun ) regime, vary with environment, defined as distance from the large-scale structure (LSS) traced by nodes and filaments in the cosmic web? (2) is there a generic 'missing dwarfs' problem in LambdaCDM predictions when all environments - and not just satellites around Milky Way like galaxies - are considered? The depth of the observational data used here enables us to construct complete, unbiased samples of galaxies, down to Mstar ~ 10^7 MSun and out to z ~ 0.4. Strong environmental differences are found for the galaxy stellar mass function when considering distance from LSS. As we move closer to LSS, the dwarf mass function becomes progressively flatter and the knee of the mass function shifts to larger stellar masses, both of which result in a higher ratio of massive to dwarf galaxies. While the stellar mass functions from the three simulations (NewHorizon, TNG50 and FIREbox) considered here do not completely agree across the dwarf regime, there is no evidence of a generic missing dwarfs problem in the context of LambdaCDM, akin to the results of recent work that demonstrates that there is no missing satellites problem around Galactic analogues.

 - **Abstract**
 We present proper motion (PM) measurements for Draco II, an ultra-faint dwarf satellite of the Milky Way. These PMs are measured using two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) imaging separated by a 7 year time baseline. Measuring PMs of low-luminosity systems is difficult due to the low number of member stars, requiring a precise inertial reference frame. We construct reference frames using three different sets of external sources: 1) stars with Gaia DR3 data, 2) stationary background galaxies, and 3) a combination of the two. We show that all three reference frames give consistent PM results. We find that for this sparse, low-luminosity regime including background galaxies into the reference frame improves our measurement by up to $\sim2\times$ versus using only Gaia astrometric data. Using 301 background galaxies as a reference frame, we find that Draco II's systemic PM is $(\mu_{\alpha}^*, \mu_{\delta}) = (1.043\pm0.029, 0.879\pm0.028)$ mas/yr, which is the most precise measurement of the three we present in this paper.
#### Dissecting the mass quenching in TNG50: Galaxy size determines the quenching mode

 - **Abstract**
 The diminishing of star formation is accompanied by size differentiating, as quiescent galaxies are more compact than star-forming galaxies at fixed stellar mass. In order to understand how galaxy quenching is related to galaxy sizes, we performed a demographic study of 46 massive quiescent central galaxies with stellar mass from $10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$ to $10^{11}\rm M_\odot$ in the TNG50 simulation. We found that, in addition to the triggering active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, galaxy size is also a major determinant of the quenching process, as small and compact galaxies are immediately quenched by the kinetic AGN feedback, while galaxies with large sizes are still active until strangulated by the cutoff of new gas replenishment. Further spatially resolved inspection reveals that this short and intense kinetic AGN feedback can only suppress the star formation within 1-2 kpc, resulting in this size-dependent effect of quenching. We also identify a long-term effect of a few Gyr timescale that the gas inflow rate is progressively suppressed after triggering kinetic feedback, which appears to effectively quench large galaxies entirely. We conclude that kinetic AGN feedback has two key roles in quenching: a short-term, intense effect that quenches the central 2 kpc region, and a long-term effect that suppresses the gas inflow rate and further quenches the entire galaxy.
#### An Extreme Scattering Event Toward PSR J2313+4253

 - **Abstract**
 We present evidence of an extreme scattering event (ESE) toward PSR J2313+4253 using high-cadence observations taken with the Green Bank Observatory 20m telescope. The high density of observations in time allow for detailed tracking of the event. We observe a pair of caustic spikes along with the characteristic drop in scintillation bandwidth that is expected during an ESE. This pattern implies that the structures predominantly responsible for scattering occur at different distances than those from previous and subsequent epochs. A secondary spectrum processed during the event shows a detached feature similar to those found in double lensing events from previously observed ESEs. We measure this event as originating from a scattering region with a distance of 1.04(1) kpc, a transverse size of 15 AU, and a duration of approximately 220 days. We model the event using a Gaussian plasma lens, which, when compared to a pure-noise model, is 197 times more probable. These rare events provide opportunities to study the properties of small-scale structures in the ISM.
#### Numerical Studies on the Radio Afterglows in TDE: Bow Shock

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of radio afterglows or delayed radio flares in tidal disruption events (TDEs) is not fully understood. They could be generated either by a forward shock (FS) propagating into diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM), or a bow shock (BS) around a dense cloud, each of which is fundamentally different. To elucidate the distinctions between these two scenarios, we conducted two-fluid simulations incorporating relativistic electrons to investigate the spatial evolution of these electrons after being accelerated by shock. Based on their spatial distribution, we performed radiative transfer calculations to obtain the synchrotron spectra. In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results for the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to that from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak frequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The radio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The combined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing significant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases producing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra. This study highlights the importance of the BS, and inspires a novel approach for probing dense gas on sub-parsec scales in galactic nuclei by decomposing the BS radio spectrum to reveal the conditions of circumnuclear dense gas.
#### Place of the Radcliffe Wave in the Local System

 - **Abstract**
 A review of publications devoted to the study of the characteristics of the Radcliffe wave has been given. The advent of mass measurements of radial velocities of stars has recently led to a number of interesting results obtained from the analysis of spatial velocities of stars and open star clusters. An important place in the study has been given to issues related to the clarification of the direct or indirect influence of magnetic fields on the process of formation of the Radcliffe wave. The hypothesis of Parker instability of the galactic magnetic field as one of the reasons for the formation of wave-type inhomogeneities in the galactic disk has been discussed.
#### The mass-metallicity relation of bulges

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Bulges, located at the central regions of galaxies, are complex structures, expected to be shaped by the physical processes involved in the assembly history of their host galaxy, such as gravitational collapse, mergers, interactions, and bars. As a consequence a variety of bulges with distinct morphology and chemistry could be produced. Aim. We aim at exploring the existence of a stellar mass-metallicity relation of bulges, MZ*R, and analyze the possible imprint of characteristics features by accretion and migration of stars, which could store information on their assembly histories. Methods. We use 44 central galaxies from the CIELO cosmological simulations. Their stellar masses are within the range of [10^7.6, 10^10.6] Msun. We decomposed the galaxy into bulge and disk using the circularity and binding energies. We track the stellar populations in bulges back in time to their birth location, classifying them as bulge-born in-situ, and disk-born stars and accreted. Results. We find that most of the stars in our bulges are formed in-situ, but 33% of our bulges show a non-negligible contribution of stellar accretion from satellites, which could add to about 35% of the population. The accreted material is generally contribute by two or three satellites at most. In some bulges, we also find up to a 32% of stars that migrated from the disk due to secular evolution, with a median of 10%. Regardless of the formation histories, we found a clear MZ*R for bulges, which is more enriched by about 0.4 dex than the corresponding relation of the disk components, and about 0.15 dex more enriched than the galaxy MZ*R. We find evidence that the dispersion in the bulge MZ*R is influenced by both stellar accretion from satellites and migration from the disk, such that, at a fixed bulge mass, bulges with higher fraction of accreted and migrated stars tend to be less metal-rich...
