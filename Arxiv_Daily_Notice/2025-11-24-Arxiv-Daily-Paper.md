#### Evolution mapping III: A new recipe for the halo mass function

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new prescription for the halo mass function (HMF) built upon the Evolution Mapping framework. This approach provides a physical motivation to parametrise the non-universality of the HMF in terms of the recent history of structure formation and the local shape of the linear matter power spectrum. Our model was calibrated against measurements from N-body simulations, with halo samples defined by ten overdensity thresholds, $\Delta$, ranging from 150 to 1600 times the mean background matter density. For our reference mass definition, $\Delta=200$, the calibrated fitting function achieves per cent-level accuracy across a wide range of masses, redshifts, and structure formation histories, and maintains this performance when tested on cosmologies with different linear power spectrum shapes. This high level of accuracy is maintained across other mass definitions, degrading only slightly to the 5 per cent level at the highest values of $\Delta$. We also provide fitting formulae to interpolate the parameters as a function of $\Delta$, which allows for accurate modelling of HMFs defined by intermediate overdensities, with accuracy still well within 5 per cent when tested on halo catalogues defined by the virial overdensity threshold. Compared to other commonly used recipes, our prescription yields competitive or superior accuracy across all redshifts and cosmologies, successfully capturing the non-universal features of the HMF where other models exhibit systematic deviations. This work provides a high-precision modelling tool for cluster abundance analyses, and demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping framework for building accurate models of observables in the non-linear regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by their environments, underscoring the environment's critical role in galaxy formation and evolution. Traditionally, these environments are categorized into four fixed classifications: knots, filaments, walls, and voids, which collectively describe the complex organization of galaxies within large-scale structures. We propose an alternative description that complements the traditional quadripartite categorization by introducing a continuous framework, allowing for a more nuanced examination of the relationship between the intrinsic properties of galaxies and their environments. This complementary description is applied using one of the most prevalent methodologies: categorization using the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix extracted from the matter density field. We integrated our findings into a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, combined with cosmological numerical simulations, to analyze how the intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by environmental changes. In our study, we find a continuous distribution of eigenvalue ratios, revealing a clear dependence of galaxy properties on their surrounding environments. This method allowed us to identify critical values at which transitions in the behavior of key astrophysical galaxy properties become evident.
#### The nature of UHE source 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and its connection to PSR J1740+1000

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16764

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-wavelength analysis of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and its surroundings including the pulsar wind nebula of middle-aged pulsar PSR J1740+1000. Although a dozen X-ray sources are found within the UHE emission site, careful analysis shows that they are unlikely to produce the observed UHE emission. The most likely particle accelerator is pulsar J1740+1000 which if offset by 13' north of the UHE source but appears to be connected to it by an extended feature seen in X-rays. For a plausible pulsar distance of 1.2 kpc, 1LHAASO J1740+0948u must be located about 5 pc away which requires rapid transport of electrons along the feature to avoid radiative losses. This poses several challenges for standard pulsar theory. Firstly, being produced $\lesssim$ 10 kyrs ago, particles must have been accelerated to the energy corresponding to a large fraction of the pulsar's full potential drop across the polar cap. Secondly, due to the lack of TeV emission extension toward the pulsar, particles must be accumulating in the UHE region. In this context, we discuss two possible scenarios: a tail filled with pulsar wind and confined by the bow-shock due to the fast pulsar's motion and an ISM filament filled by the most energetic pulsar wind particles escaping from the apex of the bow-shock.
#### Comparing galaxy merger orbits in hydrodynamical simulation and in dark-matter-only simulation

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate how the presence of baryons in simulations affects galaxy merger orbits, we compare in detail the merger timescales and orbits of the matched merger pairs in TNG100 hydrodynamical simulations and their corresponding dark-matter-only simulations, for different resolution levels. Compared with the mergers in the TNG100-1-Dark simulation without baryons, the matched mergers in the TNG100-1 simulation have similar infall time, but have statistically earlier merger times and therefore shorter merger timescales. The merger orbits for the matched pairs in the TNG100-1 and the TNG100-1-Dark simulations are similar right after infall, and both evolve to more head-on orbits at final stages, with smaller changes in the hydrodynamical simulation. In the final 2 Gyr before merger, the collision angles that represent merger orbits quantitatively are smaller in TNG100-1 than those in TNG100-1-Dark, by around 6$^\circ$ to 10$^\circ$, depending on the mass ratios and galaxy masses investigated. Our results demonstrate that the presence of baryons accelerates a bit the merger processes, and results in more spiral-in orbits for both major and minor mergers in galaxies with various stellar masses. These effects are less obvious in simulations with lower resolutions.
#### RGB Tip distance to the faint gas-rich dwarf KK 153

 - **Abstract**
 KK 153 is a star-forming dwarf galaxy that has been recently proposed as a new member of the sparsely populated class of gas-rich ultra faint dwarfs, lying in the outskirts of the Local Group. We used the Large Binocular Telescope under sub-arcsec seeing conditions to resolve for the first time the outer regions of KK 153 into individual stars, reaching the red giant branch. The magnitude of the red giant branch tip was used to measure a distance of D=3.06 (+0.17/-0.14) Mpc, much more accurate and precise than the estimate previously available in the literature, based on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (D=2.0 (+1.7/-0.8) Mpc). The new distance places KK 153 clearly beyond the boundaries of the Local Group, and, together with a new measure of the integrated magnitude, implies a stellar mass of M_*=2.4 \pm 0.2 X 10^6 M_{\sun}. The dwarf populates the extreme low-mass tail of the M_* distribution of gas-rich galaxies but it is significantly more massive than the faintest local gas-rich dwarfs, Leo T and Leo P. In analogy with similar systems, the star formation history of KK 153 may have been impacted by the re-ionisation of the Universe while keeping a sufficient gas reservoir to form new stars several Gyr later.
#### Far-infrared to centimeter emission of very nearby galaxies with archival data

 - **Abstract**
 Compared to the well-studied infrared and radio domains, galaxy emission in the millimeter (mm) - centimeter (cm) range has been less observed. In this domain, galaxy emission consists of thermal dust, free-free and synchrotron emissions with a possible additional contribution from anomalous microwave emission (AME) peaking near 1 this http URL aim of this study is to accurately characterize the integrated spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies in the mm-cm range. We used COBE-DIRBE, IRAS, Planck, and WMAP all-sky surveys, brought to the same resolution of $1^\circ$, to cover 18 photometric bands from 97$\mu$m to 1.3 cm. Given the low angular resolution and mixing with foreground and background emission that hampers the detection of the galaxy, our sample consists of 6 of the brightest, nearby galaxies: LMC, SMC, M31, M33, NGC 253 and NGC 4945. We subtract Milky Way dust emission, distant unresolved galaxies, and foreground point sources in the fields. We fit each integrated SED with a model of thermal dust, free-free, synchrotron, AME and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature fluctuations. The integrated SEDs of our sample of galaxies are well fitted by the model within the uncertainties, although degeneracies between the different components contributing to the mm-cm emission complicate the estimation of their individual contributions. We do not clearly detect AME in any of our target galaxies, and AME emissivity upper limits are weak compared to Galactic standards, suggesting that the signal of AME might be diluted at the scale of a whole galaxy. We infer positive CMB fluctuations in the background of 5 out of our 6 galaxies. This effect might be related to the degeneracy between the dust emissivity index and CMB fluctuations in the background, or linked to the specific spatial distribution of CMB fluctuations coupled with the low resolution and small number statistics.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the angular clustering and effective bias of photometrically selected quasars in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4 (KiDS DR4). We update the previous photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) of the KiDS quasars using Hybrid-z, a deep learning framework combining four-band KiDS images and nine-band KiDS+VIKING magnitudes. Hybrid-z is trained on the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 quasars matching with KiDS, and achieves average bias $\langle \delta z \rangle < 0.01$ and scatter $\sim 0.04(1 + z)$ on a test sample. The updated catalog of $\sim 157k$ quasars over $777~\mathrm{deg}^2$ is divided into four tomographic bins spanning $0.1 \leq z_{\mathrm{phot}} \leq 2.7$. In each bin, we measure the angular two-point correlation function and compare it with theoretical predictions for dark matter clustering. We estimate the best-fit scale-independent quasar bias, which increases from $b \approx 1.6$ at $z \approx 0.6$ to $b \approx 4.0$ at $z \approx 2.2$, and is well matched by a quadratic relation in redshift. Our clustering analysis indicates that KiDS quasars reside in dark matter halos of mass $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{eff}}/h^{-1}M_\odot)$ in the range $\sim 12.7$--$12.9$ and effective peak heights $\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}$ rising from $\sim 1.5$ to $2.9$ over our redshift span. We study two systematics that could affect the bias derivation: stellar contamination and the redshift distribution assumed in the theoretical modeling. The former has a negligible effect, whereas the latter significantly impacts the derived $b(z)$, emphasizing the importance of redshift calibration. Our work is the first cosmological application of quasars selected from KiDS and paves the way for future extensions in the final KiDS DR5, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope.
#### On the baryon budget in the X-ray-emitting circumgalactic medium of Milky Way-mass galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with SRG/eROSITA have revealed the average X-ray surface brightness profile of the X-ray-emitting circumgalactic medium (CGM) around Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies, offering valuable insights into the baryon mass in these systems. However, the estimation of the baryon mass depends critically on several assumptions regarding the gas density profile, temperature, metallicity, and the underlying halo mass distribution. Here, we assess how these assumptions affect the inferred baryon mass of the X-ray-emitting CGM in MW-mass galaxies, based on the stacked eROSITA signal. We find that variations in temperature profiles and uncertainties in the halo mass introduce the dominant sources of uncertainty, resulting in X-ray-emitting baryon mass estimates that vary by nearly a factor of four ($0.8-3.5\times10^{11} M_\odot$). Assumptions about metallicity contribute an additional uncertainty of approximately $50\%$. We emphasize that accurate X-ray spectral constraints on gas temperature and metallicity, along with careful modeling of halo mass uncertainty, are essential for accurately estimating the baryon mass for MW-mass galaxies. Future X-ray microcalorimeter missions will be crucial for determining the hot CGM properties and closing the baryon census at the MW-mass scale.

 - **Abstract**
 The regions around massive black holes can show X-ray variability on timescales from seconds to decades. Observing many black holes over different timescales can enhance our chances of detecting variability coming from (partial) tidal disruption events, massive black hole binaries, changing state AGN, blazar activity and much more. X-ray catalogues with hundreds of thousands of detections are treasure troves of such sources, which require innovative methods to identify these black holes. We present the current XMM-Newton catalogues available and describe several examples of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic eruption sources that have been found whilst mining this data. We describe preliminary work on a search for periodic variables in the XMM-Newton EPIC archival data, with the example of finding new massive black hole binaries. We also describe the STONKS pipeline that is now in the XMM-Newton automatic reduction pipeline and the near real-time alert system that allows the follow-up of new and fading transients. We provide examples of fading sources that are newly identified candidate TDEs.
