 - **Abstract**
 Synchrotron emission is seen in a vast array of astrophysical transients, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), radio supernovae, neutron star (NS) mergers, tidal disruption events (TDEs), and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs). Despite the ubiquity of synchrotron-emitting sources, modeling of the emergent flux from these events often relies on simplified analytic approximations. These approximations are inaccurate for high-velocity shocks, where special-relativistic effects are important. Properly incorporating these effects considerably complicates calculations, and generally requires a numerical treatment. In this work we present a novel numerical model which solves the full radiative-transfer problem in synchrotron-emitting shocks, accounting for all relativistic effects. This `full-volume' model is capable of calculating synchrotron emission from a shock of arbitrary velocity, and is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of astrophysical sources. Using this new code, we evaluate the accuracy of more commonly-used approximate models. We find that the full-volume treatment is generally necessary once the shock proper-velocity exceeds $(\Gamma\beta)_{\rm sh}\gtrsim 0.1$, and that approximate models can be inaccurate by $\gtrsim$ an order-of-magnitude in trans-relativistic shocks. This implies that there may be a bias in the inferred physical properties of some FBOTs, jetted TDEs, and other relativistic explosions, where approximate analytic models are typically employed. The code associated with our model is made publicly available, and can be used to study the growing population of relativistic synchrotron-emitting transients.
#### A HyperFlash and ÈCLAT view of the local environment and energetics of the repeating FRB 20240619D

 - **Abstract**
 Time-variable propagation effects provide a window into the local plasma environments of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Here we report high-cadence observations of FRB 20240619D, as part of the HyperFlash and ÉCLAT programs. We observed for $500$h and detected $217$ bursts, including $10$ bursts with high fluence ($>25$ Jy ms) and implied energy. We track burst-to-burst variations in dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM), from which we constrain the parallel magnetic field strength in the source's local environment: $0.32\pm0.19$ mG. Apparent DM variations between sub-bursts in a single bright event are interpreted as coming from plasma lensing or variable emission height. We also identify two distinct scintillation screens along the line of sight, one associated with the Milky Way and the other likely located in the FRB's host galaxy or local environment. Together, these (time-variable) propagation effects reveal that FRB 20240619D is embedded in a dense, turbulent and highly magnetised plasma. The source's environment is more dynamic than that measured for many other (repeating) FRB sources, but less extreme compared to several repeaters that are associated with a compact, persistent radio source. FRB 20240619D's cumulative burst fluence distribution shows a power-law break, with a flat tail at high energies. Along with previous studies, this emphasises a common feature in the burst energy distribution of hyperactive repeaters. Using the break in the burst fluence distribution, we estimate a source redshift of $z=0.042$-$0.240$. We discuss FRB 20240619D's nature in the context of similar studies of other repeating FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are believed to be an ideal laboratory for studying the evolution of accretion flow around a supermassive black hole (BH). In general, the mass feeding rate to the BH is suggested to be super-Eddington initially, and evolves to be sub-Eddington on timescale of years. In this paper, we carry out calculations of the time-dependent evolution of accretion disk in the standard environment of TDE, i.e., injecting matter at the circularization radius of the stellar debris in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$. One of the main findings is that when $\dot M_{\rm inject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on the light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to affect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light curves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an exception, when $\alpha$ is small or $R_{\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the oscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops steeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which is applied to explaining the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and ASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our time-dependent accretion disk model to explaining multi-band light curves of TDEs in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We present GDCluster, a fully automated algorithm for decomposing spectral-line datacube of interstellar gas into coherent structures. Assuming a multi-Gaussian nature of observed spectra, GDCluster employs and augments the derivative spectroscopy technique for precise parameter estimation, incorporates spatial-continuity constraints during spectral fitting, and extends these constraints to spatial clustering. This approach effectively resolves velocity blending structures in PPV space-particularly critical for ubiquitous HI spectra where emissions from multiple phases are severely blended. Applied to the all-sky HI4PI data, a 10 degree times 10 degree CRAFTS survey region, and a 45 degree times 10 degree MWISP survey region, GDCluster extracts 45,299, 2247, and 47,119 structures in HI and CO (1-0), respectively. Comparative analyses demonstrate GDCluster's superiority over DBSCAN in separating overlapping spectra with complex velocity components.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of radio emission from tidal disruption events allows for detailed constraints on the properties of ejected outflows and the host environment surrounding the black hole. However, the late-time radio behaviour of tidal disruption events is not well-studied due to a lack of observations. In this work we present long-term radio monitoring observations of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh spanning 1167-2159 days post disruption. We fit a physically motivated synchrotron model to the radio spectra at each epoch, and model the decay of the light curve under the assumption that the outflow transitions into the non-relativistic Sedov-Taylor regime at late times. Through this modelling we obtain strong constraints on the density profile of the circumnuclear medium, finding an unusually flat density profile proportional to $r^{0.24^{+0.11}_{-0.15}}$. Overall we find that unlike some tidal disruption events, AT2019azh does not show late time re-brightening up to 6 years post-disruption. The Sedov-Taylor light curve decay model provides a good fit to the data, motivating the assumption that the outflow was produced by a single ejection of material close to the time of stellar disruption. From forward modelling the evolution of the radio light curve decay we predict that the radio afterglow from AT2019azh should be detectable for decades at its current rate of evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy properties correlate with their position within the cosmic web. While galaxies are observed in an environment today, they may have experienced different environments in the past. The environmental history, linked to pre-processing, leaves an imprint on the properties of galaxies. We use the GAEA semi-analytic model and IllustrisTNG to reconstruct the environmental histories of galaxies between $z=0$ and $z=4$ that today reside in filaments. Our goal is to understand how galaxy properties are related to their past environments, and the role of the cosmic web in shaping their properties. We find that filament galaxies at $z=0$ are a heterogeneous mix of populations with distinct environmental histories. The vast majority of them have experienced group processing, with only $\sim$20\% remaining centrals throughout their life. For $\rm 9 < \log_{10}(M_{star}/M_{sun}) < 10$ galaxies, models confirm that the environmental effects are primarily driven by group processing: satellites stop growing stellar mass and exhibit elevated quenched fractions, whereas filament galaxies remain centrals have properties that are similar to field galaxies. Massive galaxies ($\rm \log_{10}(M_{star}/M_{sun}) > 10$) that have never been satellites and entered filaments more than 9 Gyr ago show accelerated stellar mass assembly and higher quenched fractions relative to the field, due to a higher frequency of merger events inside filaments, even at fixed mass. The most massive $\rm \log ((M_{star} / M_{sun}) > 11$) galaxies accreted onto filaments over 9 Gyr ago, highlighting the role of filaments in building up the high-mass end of the galaxy population. Filaments regulate galaxy evolution in a mass-dependent way: group environments regulate low-mass galaxies, while filaments favour the growth of massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the pilot survey of the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Survey (WALLABY), high-resolution neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) observations of the dwarf galaxy pair NGC 4532/DDO 137 (WALLABY J123424+062511) have revealed a huge (48 kpc) bridge of gas between the two galaxies, as well as numerous arms and clouds which connect with the even longer (0.5 Mpc) tail of gas previously discovered with the Arecibo telescope. Our modelling suggests that a combination of ram pressure and tidal forces are responsible for the nature of the system. Although the pair lies well outside of the virial radius of the Virgo cluster, ram pressure due to infall through an extensive envelope of hot gas around the cluster is most likely responsible for the HI tail. Over a timescale of 1 Gyr, the predicted electron density ($1.2\times 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and infall velocity (880 km s$^{-1}$) are probably sufficient to explain the extensive stripping from the common gaseous envelope of NGC 4532/DDO 137. The ongoing tidal interaction with the Virgo cluster appears to have prevented a rapid merger of the binary pair, with the mutual tidal interaction between the galaxy pair being responsible for raising gas from the outer parts of the galaxy potential wells into the HI bridge and common envelope. The NGC 4532/DDO 137 system mirrors many of the physical features of the Magellanic System, and may lead to a better understanding of that system, as well as casting more light on the relative importance of interaction mechanisms in the outskirts of dynamically young galaxy clusters such as Virgo.

 - **Abstract**
 We present gas-phase abundances of carbon (C), $\alpha$-elements (O, Ne, Si, and Ar) and iron (Fe) obtained from stacked spectra of high-$z$ star-forming galaxies with the deep Near Infrared Spectrograph medium-resolution data from the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. Our 564 sources at $z=4$--7 have a median stellar mass of $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})=8.46$ and a median star-formation rate of $\log(\mathrm{SFR}/M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}})=0.30$, placing them close to the star-formation main sequence. We find that the stacked spectrum of all our 564 sources has relatively low [C/O]$=-0.70$, moderate [Ne/O]$=-0.09$, and low [Ar/O]$=-0.28$ values at a low gas-phase metallicity of $12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.71$ ($Z\sim 0.1~Z_\odot$), suggesting dominant yields of core-collapse supernovae evolved from massive stars. The detection of a weak SiIII] emission line in our stacked spectrum provides a silicon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of [Si/O]$=-0.63$, which is lower than that of stars in the Milky Way disc and lower than expected by chemical evolution models, suggesting silicon depletion onto dust grains. Likewise, this Si/O value is lower than that we newly derive for two individual $z>6$ galaxies (GN-z11 and RXCJ2248) with negligible dust attenuation. By performing spectral stacking in bins of $M_{*}$, SFR, specific SFR (sSFR), and ultra-violet (UV) continuum slope $\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$, we identify [FeIII] line detections in the high-sSFR bin and the blue-$\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$ bin, both of which exhibit supersolar Fe/O ratios, while their C/O, Ar/O, and Si/O ratios are comparable to those of the all-sources stack. Our findings support a chemically young gas composition with rapid dust depletion in the general population of high-$z$ star-forming galaxies, while raising the possibility of anomalous, selective Fe/O enhancement at the very early epoch of star formation.
#### Star-forming galaxies in the cosmic web in the last 11 Gyr

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the star formation activity of galaxies depends on their position within the cosmic web using the SIMBA cosmological simulation from redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$. While previous studies found that galaxies closer to filaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether these trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy population mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies, robustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas depletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the cosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton using DisPerSE and compute each galaxy's distance to its nearest filament. After removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate (SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions as a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent modulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion, reflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend in the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances ($\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores, suggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are not driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at low redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity modulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas supply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms dominating across cosmic time.
