#### A New Boundary Condition on Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The epoch of reionization (EoR) marks the last phase transition of hydrogen in our Universe, as it evolves from cold and neutral to hot and ionized in the intergalactic medium (IGM). While its endpoint and duration can be estimated from current observations, albeit with large uncertainties, there is no known avenue to constrain its onset. We propose a novel method based on the Pearson cross-correlation coefficient between 21-cm brightness temperature maps and line-intensity maps tracing star-formation (e.g., OIII, CO, CII). This real-space estimator evolves from negative to positive as X-ray heating progresses, and saturates prior to the EoR. We predict a sharp turnover from saturation during the earliest EoR stages, when the IGM ionized fraction reaches $\bar{x}_{\rm HII}\sim 1\%-10\%$. We show that in standard scenarios, where the IGM heating precedes reionization, the turnover is a clear, model-robust signature. Its detection will provide a unique observational anchor for the EoR onset, complementing existing probes and tightening constraints on early galaxy formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is disrupted by the tidal forces of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), producing bright multi-wavelength flares. Among these events, AT2020mot has so far exhibited the highest recorded optical polarisation, with tidal shocks proposed as the primary source of its polarised emission. We present a comprehensive analysis of 13 TDEs with available polarimetric observations, aiming to determine whether the unusually high polarisation of AT2020mot stems from unique physical processes or arises from mechanisms shared by other TDEs. We present new optical polarisation measurements of TDEs obtained from multiple ground-based telescopes, combining them with optical, UV, and X-ray light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Swift observatory, respectively. We derive intrinsic TDE properties, such as SMBH and stellar masses, using MOSFiT and TDEMass, and compare them with the ones of the sample population. Our population study reveals that AT2020mot agrees with the broader TDE sample in most physical properties, including blackbody temperature, luminosity, and rise timescales. However, its optical polarisation degree is exceptionally high compared to the low or undetected polarisation observed in other events. Additionally, AT2020mot appears to have an elevated column density from our MOSFiT fits, suggesting a more complex environment than is typically assumed. We conclude that although AT2020mot fits well within the general TDE population in terms of global characteristics, its extraordinarily high polarisation and higher column density challenge current models based purely on shock or reprocessing mechanisms. More extensive, time-resolved polarimetric monitoring of newly discovered TDEs will be critical to determine whether AT2020mot represents an outlier or the extreme end of a continuum of TDE properties.
#### Exploring the History of Stellar Mergers with Chemistry: Examining the Origins of Massive $α$-Enriched Stars using Carbon Isotope Ratios

 - **Abstract**
 Recently discovered massive $\alpha$-enriched (MAE) stars have surface chemistry consistent with members of the older thick disk Milky Way population but high masses ($\sim$ 1.5 - 3 M$_{\odot}$) that suggest these stars are young. The origin of MAE stars is not fully understood although binary interactions are likely an important formation pathway. To better constrain the history of MAE stars, we have measured metallicities, carbon isotope ratios, and CNO abundances in 49 red clump stars and four red giants. Our sample included thin disk, thick disk, and MAE stars to best constrain different formation scenarios. We observed our sample stars using the Tull spectrograph on the McDonald 2.7m telescope and derived abundances using synthetic spectra created by the Turbospectrum radiative transfer code. Overall, we find that 10 of our red clump MAE stars are consistent with the average thick disk carbon isotope ratio of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 8.2 $\pm$ 3.4. We find five MAE stars that have significantly higher carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C $>$ 15) than stars at similar metallicities. Two of the anomalous stars show abundance patterns consistent with AGB mass transfer while three MAE stars have $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios similar to massive, single RC stars and show no clear signs of binarity from radial velocity monitoring or from the Gaia RUWE measurement. Overall, we find that carbon isotope ratio measurements provide a unique constraint when discerning the possible origins of MAE stars.
#### Cosmic Ray Spatial Distribution and the Galactic/Extragalactic Transition

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the spatial distribution of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) is fundamental to understand how these particles propagate in interstellar space and to infer their source spectra. The most sensitive method of studying this problem is observing the gamma--ray and neutrino diffuse fluxes produced in the inelastic interactions of CR protons and nuclei with interstellar gas that encode the energy and spatial distributions of the interacting particles. Most theoretical models assume that the spatial and energy dependencies of the spectra of CR protons and nuclei are factorized, so that the CR energy spectra have the same shape at all points of the Milky Way. However, on the base of the Fermi--LAT observations, some authors have tentatively inferred that particles in the inner regions of the Milky Way have significantly harder spectra. Recently the ground--based telescopes Tibet--AS$\gamma$, LHAASO and HAWC have extended the measurements of the diffuse gamma--ray flux to much higher energies, and the IceCube neutrino telescope has obtained evidence for a $\nu$ flux from the Galactic disk. These new measurements allow for new tests of the factorization hypothesis, and disfavor models in which the spectral shape of CR protons and nuclei is harder in the inner part of the Galaxy. In fact, the LHAASO data above 30~TeV are in better agreement with the opposite hypothesis, that cosmic rays is the inner Galaxy have softer spectra than those in the outer Galaxy. This result, that has currently only modest significance due to large statistical and systematic uncertainties, could be explained by assuming that the CR confinement volume increases with energy. An alternative explanation is that a significant fraction of cosmic rays in the multi--PeV energy range is of extragalactic origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-compact double white dwarfs (DWDs) represent key targets for multi-messenger astrophysics, as they may be observed both through gravitational waves and the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. The future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect thousands of these systems, and they are predicted to be the most numerous science targets of the mission. We develop a strategy to identify LISA source candidates in multiband photometric surveys. We constructed a synthetic EM catalogue of white dwarf (WD) detections based on a population synthesis code combined with a semi-analytical model of the Milky Way and a consistent cooling model for the evolution. We compared sources in the LISA band with other WD observations in magnitude-colour and colour-colour plots. From a full sky survey with $u \le$24.5, we find that 57$\%$ of the sources in the LISA band occupy a specific region in colour-colour diagrams. Inside this area, we find that $\sim 63\%$ (6.5 $\times 10^4$) of EM observations are LISA candidates, $\sim 31\%$ ($ 3.2 \times 10^4$) are DWDs slightly outside the LISA frequency range, and only a small contamination comes from single WDs and wider binaries. We find that the colour distributions of close DWDs represent a powerful tool to distinguish potential LISA sources from the broader WD population. This is an avenue to select candidates for further follow-up and identification.

 - **Abstract**
 The process of galaxy evolution over cosmic time is not yet fully understood, since there is a debate on the impact of galaxy collisions on the star formation and metallicity. The local environment of the galaxy mergers could also have a large impact on the evolution of the galaxies, but it has not yet been possible to examine it in detail. Modern simulations with larger capacity, including the newest physical knowledge and new observations with JWST, help us to answer these questions. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation, we processed the catalogue data and the merger tree files of the TNG300-1 simulation. We calculated the galaxies average star formation rate (SFR) and mass at redshifts between 0 < z < 15. We investigated the environment of galaxy mergers, with the focus on the local density, and also examined how the SFR changes in merging galaxies. We compared our findings with JWST results and highlighted differences in the star formation rate density (SFRD) history between the models and observations.
#### Gas-rich dwarf galaxy multiples in the Apertif HI survey

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf-dwarf galaxy encounters are a key aspect of galaxy evolution as they can ignite or temporarily suppress star formation in dwarfs and can lead to dwarf mergers. However, the frequency and impact of dwarf encounters remain poorly constrained due to limitations of spectroscopic studies, e.g. surface-brightness incompleteness of optical studies and poor spatial resolution of single-dish neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys. We aim to quantify the frequency of isolated gas-rich dwarf galaxy multiples using the untargeted, interferometric Apertif HI survey and study the impact of the interaction on star formation rates of galaxies as a function of the on-sky separation. Our parent dwarf sample consists of 2481 gas-rich galaxies with stellar masses 10^6 < M_* / M_Sun < 5*10^9, for which we identify close companions based on projected separation (r_p) and systemic velocity difference (Del_V_sys). We explore both constant thresholds for r_p and Del_V_sys corresponding to 150 kpc and 150 km/s on all galaxies in our sample, and mass-dependent thresholds based on a stellar-to-halo mass relation. We find the average number of companions per dwarf in our sample to be 13% (20%) when considering mass-dependent (constant) thresholds. In the stellar mass regime of 2*10^8 < M_* / M_Sun < 5*10^9, we find a three times higher frequency (11.6%) of dwarf companions than previously determined from optical spectroscopic studies, highlighting the power of HI for finding dwarf multiples. Furthermore, we find evidence for an increase in star formation rates (SFRs) of close dwarf galaxy pairs of galaxies with similar stellar masses.
#### Build-up and survival of the disc: From numerical models of galaxy formation to the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 We study the build-up and survival of angular momentum in the stellar disc using a statistical suite of cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. Our results show that stellar kinematics at $z=0$ rarely recover the true times of disc spin-up, due to the disruptive impact of massive radial merger events. The proto-disc (i.e. Aurora) and kicked-up disc stars (the Splash) become indistinguishable at low metallicities, and the local fraction of kicked-up disc stars remains $<20$ per cent even in the case of major mergers. In contrast, observations from Gaia and legacy surveys reveal that Galactic $\alpha$-rich populations as old as $\tau=13.5\,\rm{Gyr}$ show significant rotation, with median $\eta > 0.75$. This places strong constraints on the merger ratio between the proto-Milky Way and its last significant merger (Gaia-Sausage Enceladus, GSE), favouring values of $\lesssim 1:7$. We present the age-metallicity relation for the stellar halo and estimate the interaction epoch at $\tau_{\rm{spin\text{-}up}}\simeq\tau_{\rm{GSE}}\sim11\,\rm{Gyr}$. We note an abrupt dearth of halo and Splash stars after a lookback time of $10\,\rm{Gyr}$, marking the end of the merger interaction. Finally, we show that Globular Clusters in the metallicity range $-0.8<\rm{[Fe/H]}<-0.3$ align with a formation time of $\tau_{\rm{starburst}}\sim11\,\rm{Gyr}$, which we interpret as a signature of a starburst triggered by the first pericentric interaction of the GSE. This is remarkable corroboration between our GSE interaction and starburst times of $\tau_{\rm GSE}=\tau_{\rm starburst} \sim 11\,$Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and densest stellar systems in the Universe, yet how they form remains a mystery. Here we present a suite of cosmological simulations in which both dark-matter-free GCs and dark-matter-rich dwarf galaxies naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology. We show that these objects inhabit distinct locations in the size-luminosity plane and that they have similar ages, age spread, metallicity and metallicity spread to globulars and dwarfs in the nearby Universe. About half of our simulated globulars form by means of regular star formation near the centres of their host dwarf, with the rest forming further out, triggered by mergers. The latter are more tidally isolated and more likely to survive to the present day. Finally, our simulations predict the existence of a new class of object that we call 'globular-cluster-like dwarfs' (GCDs). These form from a single, self-quenching, star-formation event in low-mass dark-matter halos at high redshift and have observational properties intermediate between globulars and dwarfs. We identify several dwarfs in our Galaxy, such as Reticulum II (refs. 2-4), that could be in this new class. If so, they promise unprecedented constraints on dark-matter models and new sites to search for metal-free stars.
#### Environmental vs. intrinsic quenching at cosmic noon: Predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations for VLT-MOONRISE

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation into the quenching of simulated galaxies across cosmic time, honing in on the role played by both intrinsic and environmental mechanisms at different epochs. In anticipation of VLT-MOONRISE, the first wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey to target cosmic noon, this work provides clear predictions to compare to the future observations. We investigate the quenching of centrals, high-mass satellites, and low-mass satellites from two cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: IllustrisTNG and EAGLE. Satellites are split according to bespoke mass thresholds, designed to separate environmental and intrinsic quenching mechanisms. To determine the best parameter for predicting quiescence, we apply a Random Forest classification analysis for each galaxy class at each epoch. The Random Forest classification determines supermassive black hole mass as the best predictor of quiescence in centrals and high-mass satellites. Alternatively, the quenching of low-mass satellites is best predicted by group halo mass, at all epochs. Additionally, we investigate the evolution in the dependence of the quenched fraction with various parameters, revealing a more complex picture. There is strong evidence for the rejuvenation of star formation from z = 2 to z = 0 in EAGLE, but not in IllustrisTNG. The starkest discrepancy between simulations rests in the mass threshold analysis. While IllustrisTNG predicts the existence of environmentally quenched satellites visible within the survey limits of MOONRISE, EAGLE does not. Hence, MOONRISE will provide critical data that is needed to evaluate current models, and constrain future models, of quenching processes.
#### 1.8 per cent measurement of $H_0$ from Cepheids alone

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most pressing problems in current cosmology is the cause of the Hubble tension. We revisit a two-rung distance ladder, composed only of Cepheid periods and magnitudes, anchor distances in the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 4258, and host galaxy redshifts. We adopt the SH0ES data for the most up-to-date and carefully vetted measurements, where the Cepheid hosts were selected to harbour also Type Ia supernovae. We introduce two important improvements: a rigorous selection modelling and a state-of-the-art density and peculiar velocity model using Manticore-Local, based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm. We infer $H_0 = 71.7 \pm 1.3\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, assuming the Cepheid host sample was selected by estimated supernova magnitudes. Less plausible selection criteria shift $H_0$ by about one standard deviation. The posterior has a lower central value and a 45 per cent smaller error than a previous study using the same data. The result is also slightly lower than the supernova-based SH0ES inferred value of $H_0 = 73.2 \pm 0.9\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and is in $3.3\sigma$ tension with the latest standard cosmological model microwave background results. These results demonstrate that a measurement of $H_0$ of sufficient precision to weigh in on the Hubble tension is achievable using second-rung data alone, underscoring the importance of robust and accurate statistical modelling.
