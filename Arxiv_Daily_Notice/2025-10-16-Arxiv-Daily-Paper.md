### Today: 6papers 
#### Constraining Ultra-Light Dark Matter mass with Dwarf Galaxy Rotation Curves
 - **Authors:** Tian-yao Fang, Ming-Chung Chu
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12848

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12848

 - **Abstract**
 While ultra-light bosonic dark matter (ULDM) in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state could naturally account for the central core in some galaxies and resolve the core-cusp problem, the dark matter density distribution in the outer regions of galaxies remains less explored. We propose a trial wavefunction to model the ULDM distribution beyond the BEC core. We derive the corresponding rotation velocity curve, which shows excellent agreement with those of 12 dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The best-fit ULDM particle mass for each dwarf galaxy falls within a strikingly narrow range of $m=(1.8-3.2)\times 10^{-23}\text{eV}$.
#### Only the Special Survive: Evolution of Long-Lived Star Clusters in Galaxy Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we aim to answer one crucial question behind the discrepancy between chemical trends of field stars and clusters in the Galactic disk: is the chemical gradient mismatch driven by cluster migration and differential survivability as a function of galactic location? To answer this question, we explored the evolution of long-lived (> 1 Gyr) star clusters in Milky Way-galaxy simulations. In particular, we investigated why some star clusters remain bound over billions of years. We have traced the unique trajectories for a sample of open clusters around two FIRE galaxies throughout cosmic time. Additionally, we characterized the small-scale environment surrounding these clusters over their orbital history. We see that clusters across both FIRE galaxies spend the majority of their lives in under-dense regions of gas, except for brief passages where they interact with gas clouds, causing their orbits to be altered.
#### When Tiny Halos Stir Spacetime: Gravitational Waves from Fifth-Force Mergers
 - **Authors:** Xinpeng Wang, Yifan Lu, Zachary S. C. Picker, Alexander Kusenko, Misao Sasaki
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12984

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12984

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter fermions interacting via attractive fifth forces mediated by a light mediator can form dark matter halos in the very early universe. We show that bound systems composed of these halos are capable of generating gravitational wave (GW) signals detectable today, even when the individual halos are very light. The Yukawa force dominates the dynamics of these halo binaries, rather than gravity. As a result, large GW signals can be produced at initially extremely high frequencies, which are then redshifted to frequency bands accessible to current or future GW observatories. In addition, the resulting GW signals carry distinctive features that enable future observations to distinguish them from conventional ones. Notably, even if only a tiny fraction of dark matter experiences strong fifth-force interactions, such effects provide a new avenue to discover self-interacting dark matter through GW observations.
#### Numerical Cosmology
 - **Authors:** Romain Teyssier
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13129

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13129

 - **Abstract**
 In these lecture notes, we describe the current state-of-the-art for numerical simulations of large-scale structure and galaxy formation. Numerical simulations play a central role in the preparation and the exploitation of large-scale galaxy surveys, in which galaxies are the fundamental observational objects. We first describe basic methods for collisionless N-body dynamics that enable us to model dark matter accurately by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations. We then discuss simple methods to populate dark matter halos with galaxies, such as Halo and Sub-halo Abundance Matching techniques and baryonification techniques for capturing baryonic effects on the matter distribution. We finally describe how to model the gas component by solving the Euler-Poisson equations, focusing on the foundational assumptions behind these equations, namely local thermo-dynamical equilibrium, and the nature of the truncation errors of the numerical scheme, namely numerical diffusion. We show a few examples of simulations of a Milky-Way-like halo without cooling, with cooling and with star formation. We finally describe different subgrid prescriptions recently developed to model star formation, supernovae feedback and active galactic nuclei and how they impact cosmological simulations.
#### The dependence of black hole formation in open clusters on the cluster formation process
 - **Authors:** Jian-Wen Zhou
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13241

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13241

 - **Abstract**
 We performed N-body simulations of both individual cluster evolution and subcluster coalescence, demonstrating that cluster evolution and its outcomes strongly depend on the cluster formation process through comparisons of different gas expulsion modes and formation channels. The evolution of star clusters is significantly shaped by the gas expulsion mode, with faster expulsion producing greater mass loss. A broader degeneracy exists among initial cluster mass, gas expulsion timescale, and formation channel (monolithic vs. coalescence), which manifests in both evolutionary pathways and black hole production. In individual cluster simulations, slower gas expulsion enables progressively lower-mass clusters to retain central black holes within the tidal radius. As the gas expulsion mode transitions from fast to moderate to slow, the fraction of high-velocity stars decreases. Variations in gas expulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity distribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which governs both cluster mass loss and black hole retention. Slowly expanding clusters are more likely to retain black holes and multiple systems, making them prime candidates for black hole searches with {\it Gaia}. Our results highlight the crucial influence of early gas expulsion and cluster formation mechanisms on the dynamical evolution of star clusters and black hole production. These factors should be carefully incorporated into the initial conditions of N-body simulations, which necessarily rely on input from the star formation community.
#### $\texttt{SBi3PCF:}$ Simulation-based inference with the integrated 3PCF
 - **Authors:** David Gebauer, Anik Halder, Stella Seitz, Dhayaa Anbajagane
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13805

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13805

 - **Abstract**
 We present $\texttt{SBi3PCF}$, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for analysing a higher-order weak lensing statistic, the integrated 3-point correlation function (i3PCF). Our approach forward-models the cosmic shear field using the $\texttt{CosmoGridV1}$ suite of N-body simulations, including a comprehensive set of systematic effects such as intrinsic alignment, baryonic feedback, photometric redshift uncertainty, shear calibration bias, and shape noise. Using this, we have produced a set of DES Y3-like synthetic measurements for 2-point shear correlation functions $\xi_{\pm}$ (2PCFs) and i3PCFs $\zeta_{\pm}$ across 6 cosmological and 11 systematic parameters. Having validated these measurements against theoretical predictions and thoroughly examined for potential systematic biases, we have found that the impact of source galaxy clustering and reduced shear on the i3PCF is negligible for Stage-III surveys. Furthermore, we have tested the Gaussianity assumption for the likelihood of our data vector and found that while the sampling distribution of the 2PCF can be well approximated by a Gaussian function, the likelihood of the combined 2PCF + i3PCF data vector including filter sizes of $90'$ and larger can deviate from this assumption. Our SBI pipeline employs masked autoregressive flows to perform neural likelihood estimation and is validated to give statistically accurate posterior estimates. On mock data, we find that including the i3PCF yields a substantial $63.8\%$ median improvement in the figure of merit for $\Omega_m - \sigma_8 - w_0$. These findings are consistent with previous works on the i3PCF and demonstrate that our SBI framework can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to analyse the i3PCF in wide-area weak lensing surveys.
