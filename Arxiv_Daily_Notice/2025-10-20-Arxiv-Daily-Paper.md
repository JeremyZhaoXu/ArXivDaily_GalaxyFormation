 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) host multiple stellar populations differing in their chemical and dynamical properties. A number of models for the formation of multiple populations predict that the subsystem of second generation (SG) stars is characterized by a more centrally concentrated spatial distribution and a more rapid rotation than the system of first generation (FG) stars. We present the results of N-body simulations exploring the long-term dynamical evolution of rotating multiple-population GCs. We study the evolution of systems starting with four different orientations of the GC's total internal angular momentum vector relative to the orbital angular momentum. We explore the evolution driven by two-body relaxation and the effects of the GC's interaction with the galactic tidal field. We focus on the kinematic differences between the two generations and we quantify them by exploring the FG and SG rotation velocity and angular momenta. We find that kinematic differences between the generations persist for most of the GCs' lifetimes, although the strength of these differences decreases after a few relaxation times. The differences can be seen most clearly in the lowest-mass stars. We find that the GCs' internal angular momentum gradually aligns with the orbital angular momentum, although there is little difference in this alignment between the FG and SG systems. We also find that stars in the GC's outer regions align with the orbital angular momentum vector more rapidly than those in the inner regions leading to a variation of the orientation of the internal angular momentum with the clustercentric distance. The alignment between internal angular momentum and orbital angular momentum occurs more rapidly for low-mass stars. We study the evolution of the anisotropy in the velocity distribution and find the SG to be characterized by a stronger radial anisotropy than the FG.(abridged)
#### Spectroscopic Follow-up of Young High-$α$ Dwarf Star Candidates: Still Likely Genuinely Young

 - **Abstract**
 The question of whether genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars exist has been discussed for over a decade since their discovery from asteroseismology of giant stars as it is challenging to break the degeneracy between the binary interaction and the genuinely young scenarios. Young high-$\alpha$ stars are hard to explain with traditional chemical evolution model as the high-$\alpha$ disk is typically associated with the early epoch of star formation in the Milky Way. Combined with recent advances of gyrochronology, and that $^7$Li can serve as an unambiguous indicator for identifying merger products in dwarfs thanks to its low burning temperature, we identified young high-$\alpha$ dwarf candidate stars through their fast rotation in a previous study. In this paper, we performed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates using Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI), and confirm 3 additional stars that are most likely genuinely young. Together with the star from the earlier paper, we find three out of four of them center around [Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, are ~5 Gyr old, and have a similar amount of elevated Li (~0.5 dex) and Al (~0.1 dex) compared to stars with matching $\log g$, $T_{\rm eff}$, Mg, and Fe within observational uncertainties, hinting at their common formation pathway.
#### A rising tide: Intrinsic alignments since the turn of the millennium

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15738

 - **Abstract**
 The alignments of galaxies across the large-scale structure of the Universe are known to be a source of contamination for gravitational lensing, but they can also probe cosmology and the physics of galaxy evolution in many ways. In this review, I cover developments in our understanding of intrinsic alignments over the past 25 years on: (1) different approaches to model intrinsic alignments across a range of scales, (2) existing observational constraints, (3) predictions from cosmological numerical $N$-body and hydrodynamical simulations, (4) mitigation strategies to account for their contamination to lensing observables and (5) cosmological and astrophysical applications. While the review focuses mostly on two-point statistics of intrinsic alignments, I also give a summary of other statistics beyond two-point. Finally, I point out some of the open problems hindering the understanding or application of intrinsic alignments and how they might be overcome in the future.
#### The kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich effect as a benchmark for AGN feedback models in hydrodynamical simulations: insights from DESI + ACT

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic feedback remains one of the largest uncertainties in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, with different prescriptions producing divergent predictions for the fraction of gas expelled from halos, the radial extent of the gas expulsion and the impact on large scale matter clustering. We present the first systematic study of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect across a wide range of simulations (FLAMINGO, ANTILLES, BAHAMAS, SIMBA, FABLE and their variants), and compare them directly to DESI Year 1 + ACT kSZ measurements. We ensure a like-for-like comparison with observations by developing a robust methodology that accounts for the halo mass selection using galaxy-galaxy lensing, cosmic variance, miscentering and satellites, establishing the kSZ effect as a new benchmark for the simulations. We find that fiducial feedback models are disfavoured by >3 sigma, while simulations with more powerful AGN feedback within the FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS suites, as well as SIMBA, reproduce the observed kSZ signal within <2 sigma. We use the ANTILLES simulation suite to demonstrate that the amplitude of the kSZ effect is a strong predictor of matter power spectrum suppression, competitive with baryon fraction metrics. These results establish the kSZ as a critical probe for evaluating feedback physics and for advancing the fidelity of cosmological simulations.
