#### Stellar velocity distributions in binary-rich ultrafaint dwarf galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies are dominated by dark matter, the distribution of which may be inferred from the kinematics of that galaxy's stellar population. Star-by-star observations are available for the satellite UFD galaxies of the Milky Way, making them uniquely good laboratories in which to test cosmological predictions at the smallest scales. However, the kinematics of these galaxies are complicated by the presence of binary stars, which alter the stellar velocity distribution. In particular these binary stars increase the galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion, which is related to the total galactic mass by the virial theorem. Without correctly eliminating or accounting for binary stars we may therefore overestimate the masses of UFD galaxies or even confuse globular clusters for UFD galaxies. Here we write down the probability density function for the observed line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of a stellar population containing both visual and spectroscopic binary stars, which we then use to determine the effect of those binary stars on the observed LOS velocity dispersion. For the coldest UFD galaxies the fractional increase in LOS velocity dispersion is of order one and for the coldest globular clusters is of order 100. However, if the stellar initial mass function is bottom light, as it may be for UFD galaxies and globular clusters, then both of these values increase by half a dex.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed radio study of the tidal disruption events (TDEs) AT 2020zso and AT 2021sdu. Both exhibit transient radio emission beginning shortly after optical discovery and persisting for several years. For AT 2020zso, we identify two distinct radio flares. The first arises soon after the optical peak, reaching a maximum $\sim1$ year post-discovery before fading. The second flare appears $\sim800$ days after discovery and results in the brief presence of two distinct components in the radio spectra, providing strong evidence for physically separate outflows. Both flares are consistent with non-relativistic outflows, with velocities $v\approx0.1-0.2c$ and energies $E\sim10^{49}$ erg, propagating through a Bondi-like circumnuclear medium. Our analysis supports a scenario in which the first outflow is accretion-driven, launched while the TDE disk is accreting at a relatively high Eddington fraction, whereas the second outflow is associated with a transition to an advection-dominated accretion flow. In contrast, the radio emission from AT 2021sdu is best explained by a slower ($v\approx0.03c$), less energetic outflow ($E\sim10^{48}$ erg), combined with diffuse, non-variable host emission that becomes dominant $\sim500$ days after discovery. Assuming free expansion, we infer an outflow launch date preceding the optical discovery date. This suggests that the outflow may originate from either the unbound stellar debris ejected during disruption or, alternatively, from a decelerating outflow. Our findings demonstrate the diversity of outflow properties in TDEs and highlight the observational challenges of interpreting late-time radio variability in the presence of host galaxy contamination.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of nuclear discs in barred disc galaxies has been demonstrated in studies on stellar structures and kinematics. It is thus imperative to establish their fundamental properties and scaling relations, which can help understanding their connection to other central stellar structures, including nuclear star clusters. In this Letter, we use results from the structural analysis and star formation histories of a sample of galaxies with nuclear discs to show the distributions of fundamental parameters and scaling relations. Our analysis shows that the nuclear disc mass-size relation, and the relation between the nuclear disc mass and the stellar mass of its host galaxy, are - at face value - different from the corresponding relations for nuclear star clusters, but marginally compatible given the uncertainties. This sets constraints to scenarios in which their formation is connected. We also find that the nuclear disc in the Milky Way is on the shorter end of the distribution of sizes set by nuclear discs in other galaxies. This is the first analysis of this kind for kinematically confirmed nuclear discs, and further understanding of the properties of the nuclear disc in the Milky Way and other galaxies is necessary to corroborate these results.
#### Tidal Disruption of Super Star Clusters as the origin of Bluish Light at the inner region of the Perseus Cluster Central Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Relatively blue light extends beyond a spiral disk from a radius of ~5 kpc out to ~14 kpc from the center of NGC 1275. Analyses of its spectrum and broadband colors reveal a population of young stars having sub-solar metallicities superposed on a dominant population of old stars having super-solar metallicities. The young stars have a characteristic age of ~160 Myr and may span ages of a few hundred Myr, similar to that of stars comprising the central spiral disk, and a total mass about one-third that of this disk for a combined stellar mass (at birth) of ~4 $\times$ 10$^9$ $\rm M_\odot$. A multitude of arc-like features embedded in the extended blue light have brightnesses comparable to the somewhat older (~500 Myr) super star clusters (SSCs) projected against the central spiral disk. The SSCs have a relatively shallow mass function, suggesting that the tidal disruption of an initially larger population that we estimate could have had an initial total mass (far) exceeding ~1 $\times$ 10$^9$ $\rm M_\odot$ gave rise to the extended blue light -- the arc-like features corresponding to stellar streams tracing disrupted star clusters -- and perhaps also the central spiral disk. We speculate that, beginning about 500 Myr ago, an enhanced episode of AGN activity in NGC 1275, leaving still visible X-ray bubbles, induced vigorous cooling of the intracluster medium to fuel the formation of numerous star clusters: many were tidally disrupted to leave bluish light at the inner region of this galaxy, with the survivors being the SSCs projected against the central spiral disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are dense star clusters found in all massive galaxies. Recent work has established that they follow a tight relation between their internal stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and luminosity, enabling accurate distance measurements. In this work, we aim to apply this GC velocity dispersion (GCVD) distance method to measure the distance to M 104 (NGC 4594, the Sombrero galaxy). We have measured internal stellar velocity dispersions for 85 globular clusters (GCs) and one ultra-compact dwarf galaxy around M 104 using high-resolution multi-object integrated-light spectroscopy with FLAMES/GIRAFFE on the Very Large Telescope. The measured velocity dispersions range from $\sigma = 4 - 30$ km s$^{-1}$, with a mean uncertainty of $\Delta\sigma = 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$. For a subset of 77 GCs with $V$-band magnitudes and reliable velocity dispersion measurements above $\sigma > 4$ km s$^{-1}$, we constructed the $M_V$-$\sigma$ relation to measure the distance to M 104, finding $D=9.00\pm0.29$ (stat.) $\pm0.26$ (sys.) Mpc. The GCs follow the Milky Way and M 31 $M_V-\sigma$ relation closely, with the exception of the luminous ultra-compact dwarf SUCD1, which is nearly one magnitude brighter than the mean relation. 29 GCs in the sample have sizes determined from Hubble Space Telescope imaging which allowed us to determine their masses and $V$-band dynamical mass-to-light ratios (M/L$_V$). We find a mean $<M/L_V> = 2.6 \pm 0.8 M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$ for the luminous ($M_V < -8$ mag) M 104 GCs, which is higher than the Milky Way GCs, but is reminiscent of the brightest GCs in Centaurus A. With the exception of SUCD1, the GCs of M 104 follow the GCVD relation irrespective of their mass-to-light ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 Reliable estimation of stellar surface gravity (log $g$) for a large sample is crucial for evaluating stellar evolution models and understanding galactic structure; However, it is not easy to accomplish due to the difficulty in gathering a large spectroscopic data set. Photometric sky survey using a specific filter, on the other hand, can play a substantial role in the assessment of log $g$. The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES) utilizes eight filters to provide accurate stellar parameters for $\sim10^{7}$ stars, with its DDO51 intermediate-band filter specifically designed for robust log $g$ determination. In this work, the observed SAGES $u_{\rm SC}$ and $v_{\rm SAGES}$ photometry, the synthetic photometry in $g$, $r$, $i$, and DDO51 bands derived from \textit{Gaia} XP spectra are employed to investigate the importance of the DDO51 filter in the determination of log $g$. We applied machine-learning-based extinction correction and employed XGBoost models, trained on stellar parameters from LAMOST, to predict log $g$ using photometric data. By comparing model predicted log $g$ with LAMOST values, we find that including DDO51 filter improve the accuracies of log $g$ estimates by 21.0\% (from 0.224\,dex to 0.177\,dex) overall, and by 26.5\% (from 0.302\,dex to 0.222\,dex ) for GK-type stars, as compared to those obtained without DDO51. The DDO51 filter is also validated to be particularly effective for metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$<$-1.0), where it significantly mitigates systematic biases. Our findings highlight the diagnostic power of the SAGES DDO51 filter, providing enhanced stellar characterization vital for future in-depth studies of the Milky Way.
