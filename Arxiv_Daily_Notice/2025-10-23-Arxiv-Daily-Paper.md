 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of molecular gas on small scales regulates star formation and the growth of supermassive black holes in galaxy centers, yet the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in shaping this distribution remains poorly constrained. We investigate how AGN influence the small-scale structure of molecular gas in galaxy centers, by measuring the clumpiness of CO(3 - 2) emission observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the nuclear regions (50 - 200 pc from the AGN) of 16 nearby Seyfert galaxies from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). To quantify clumpiness, we apply three different methods: (1) the median of the pixel-by-pixel contrast between the original and smoothed maps; (2) the ratio of the total excess flux to the total flux, after substracting the background smoothed emission; and (3) the fraction of total flux coming from clumpy regions, interpreted as the mass fraction in clumps. We find a negative correlation between molecular gas clumpiness and AGN X-ray luminosity (L_X), suggesting that higher AGN activity is associated with smoother gas distributions. All methods reveal a turnover in this relation around L_X = 10^{42} erg/s, possibly indicating a threshold above which AGN feedback becomes efficient at dispersing dense molecular structures and suppressing future star formation. Our findings provide new observational evidence that AGN feedback can smooth out dense gas structures in galaxy centers.
#### Dark Matter profiles of "in silico" galaxies: deep learning inference

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning has the potential to improve the reconstruction of the dark matter profile of galaxies with respect to traditional methods, like rotation curves. We demonstrate on the simulation suite Illustris-TNG that a steerable equivariant convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to infer the dark matter profiles within and around individual galaxies from photometric and interferometric data, improving on a standard CNN. Within the in silico environment of the simulations, our architecture is able to capture the dark matter distribution within galaxies without a parametrization of the profile. We perform an interpretability analysis to understand the internal mechanisms of the trained model and the most important data features used to estimate the dark matter profiles. The equivariant CNN recovers the dark matter profile of galaxies within the stellar mass range $[10^{10} - 10^{12} ]$ $M_{\odot}$ with excellent precision and accuracy: the mean squared error is reduced by a factor of ~ 3 from its value under the training distribution, demonstrating that the network has learnt from the data features. While this holds within the controlled 'in silico' environment of the simulation, we argue that few additional steps are needed before this method can be reliably applied to galaxies in the real field observations.
#### Accreted stars and stellar haloes of simulated galaxies in TNG50

 - **Abstract**
 We use the TNG50 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to study the accreted stellar component and stellar haloes of isolated galaxies spanning a wide range of masses ($10^8<M_*/M_\odot<10^{11}$). We find that stars formed in the main progenitor (i.e., in-situ stars) typically dominate the inner regions as far as $\sim$10 half-light radii from the centre, implying that detecting uncontrovertible evidence for the presence of an accreted stellar halo requires probing the far outskirts of a galaxy. Stars from accreted, disrupted satellites (i.e., ex-situ stars) dominate beyond that radius (roughly $25\%$ of the virial radius, $r_{200}$), which we identify as the inner boundary of the outer stellar halo. The fraction of accreted stars decreases monotonically with decreasing galaxy mass, $M_*$, from $\sim$$20\%$ on average in $\sim$$2\times 10^{12}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{11}\, M_\odot$) to $2$-$3\%$ in $\sim$$2\times 10^{10}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{8}\, M_\odot$). The outer halo has a mass comparable to roughly $10\%$ of all accreted stars. Fewer than $\sim$$30\%$ of stars in the outer halo are in-situ stars, many of which originate from star-forming satellites during the late stages of disruption, especially in low-mass systems. Accreted stars are systematically more metal poor in less massive systems, which makes the outer haloes of dwarf galaxies a fertile hunting ground for extremely metal-poor stars. At given galaxy mass, the more massive stellar haloes are systematically more concentrated (smaller $R_{\rm eff}$) and have steeper density profiles (larger $n$). Our results provide a blueprint for interpreting observations of the outskirts of isolated galaxies in terms of their assembly histories.
#### Resolving the Nuclear Environments of Tidal Disruption Event Host Galaxies within 45 pc

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18985

 - **Abstract**
 Using HST/STIS observations, we present the highest-spatial-resolution spectroscopic study to date of four tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies, with the best observed being the post-starburst (PSB) host of ASASSN-14li. The stellar population of ASASSN-14li's host, within 44 pc of the nucleus, reveals a younger recent starburst ($\sim$340 Myr) compared to the population at an offset radius of 88 pc that excludes the nucleus ($\sim$550 Myr), a radial age gradient suggesting gas inflows from a minor merger. We estimate a stellar density of $\sim5900 \pm 800 \, M_\odot / \mathrm{pc}^3$ within 30 pc of the nucleus of ASASSN-14li's host, exceeding densities expected for nuclear star clusters. High-ionization ``coronal" emission lines, [Fe VI] $\lambda 5677$, [Fe VII] $\lambda 6087$, and [Fe X] $\lambda 6375$, are also detected within the nuclear spectra of the hosts of ASASSN-14li and PTF09ge, importantly alongside the non-detection of [O III] at the same scale. We similarly do not detect [O III] in the nuclear region of ASASSN-14ae's host despite its presence in the SDSS spectrum. The different ionization radiation levels detected at various radii from TDE host nuclei may indicate echoes of earlier accretion episodes, including, potentially, a prior TDE. We posit that a minor merger driving gas inflow to the nucleus could drive the enhanced TDE rates in post-starburst galaxies, inducing variation in nuclear gas properties and star formation history on $<$150 pc scales in TDE hosts.
#### BaryonBridge: Stochastic Interpolant Model for Fast Hydrodynamical Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Constructing a general-purpose framework for mapping between dark matter simulations and observable hydrodynamical simulation outputs is a long-standing problem in modern astrophysics. In this work, we present a new approach utilizing stochastic interpolants to map between cheap fast particle mesh simulations and baryonic quantities in three dimensions, requiring a total of 7 GPU minutes per 256^3 grid size simulation. Using the CAMELS multifield dataset, we are able to condition our mapping on both cosmological and astrophysical properties. We focus this work on hydrodynamical quantities suitable for Lya observables finding excellent agreement up to small spatial scales, k ~ 10.0 (h^(-1) Mpc) at z=2.0, for Lya flux statistics. Our approach is fully convolutional, allowing training on comparatively small volumes and application to larger volumes, which was tested on TNG50.
#### Beyond single tracers: CNN-based inference of galaxy mass profiles from combined gas and stellar kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether combining gas and stellar kinematic maps provides measurable advantages in recovering galaxy mass profiles, compared to using single-component maps alone. While traditional methods struggle to integrate multi-tracer data effectively, we test whether deep learning models can leverage this joint information. We develop a probabilistic convolutional neural network (CNN) framework trained and tested on mock galaxy kinematic maps from multiple cosmological simulation suites. Our model is trained on gas-only, stars-only, and combined gas+stellar velocity maps, allowing direct comparison of performance across tracers. To assess robustness, we include simulations with differing feedback models and galaxy properties. Combining gas and stellar maps reduces the dispersion in the inferred mass profiles by up to a factor of $\sim$1.5 compared to models using either tracer independently. The CNN architecture effectively captures complementary information from the two components. However, we find limitations in generalizing between simulation suites, with reduced performance when applying models trained on one suite to galaxies from another.
