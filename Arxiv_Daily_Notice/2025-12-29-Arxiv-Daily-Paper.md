 - **Abstract**
 Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have recently been proposed as potential probes for Population III stars. However, the properties of the accretion flow and the wind from the Pop III star TDE system are not clear. By performing radiative hydrodynamic simulations, we study the 'circularized' accretion flow of the Pop III star TDE system. The masses of the black hole (BH) and the disrupted star are $10^6$ and $300$ solar masses, respectively. We focus on the properties of the wind. We find that the black hole accretion rate is highly super-Eddington. A strong wind is driven by radiation pressure. Due to the presence of a strong wind, only $25\%$--$35\%$ of the fallback debris is accreted by the BH. The remaining part is taken away by the wind. The kinetic power of the wind can be as high as $10^{46} {\rm \ erg \ s^{-1}}$. The properties of the wind obtained in this paper may be useful for understanding the radiation properties of Pop III star TDEs in the context of the wind 'reprocessing' model.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations claim the existence of a significant fraction of bars in the kinematically hotter and thicker disk at high redshift Universe. These observations challenge the current understanding of disk stability in galaxies similar to the Milky Way. The analytical work and N-body simulations suggest that the kinematically hot (dispersion-dominated) and thick disk are stable against bar formation. In this work, we perform the controlled N-body simulations of a kinematically hot and thick disk, which is residing in a non-rotating and spinning dark matter halo. We report that the disk, which is classically stable against bar instability in the live and non-rotating halo, leads to bar formation in a spinning halo environment. The spinning halo model is 8 times more efficient in transporting angular momentum from the disk to the halo compared to the non-spinning halo. We claim that Ostriker-Peebles and ELN bar formation criteria do not predict bar formation for both the non-roating and spinning halo. The recent criteria from Jang-Kim successfully predict the bar stability for the non-rotating halo model, but not for the spinning halo model. These results provide an important insight into the bar formation processes for thick and hot disks at high redshift.
#### VLBI Diagnostics of Off-axis Jets in Radio Flares of Tidal Disruption Events

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of late-time radio flares in tidal disruption events remains unclear. In particular, the peculiar radio flare observed in AT2018hyz has motivated two leading scenarios: a delayed outflow launched $\sim1000\,\rm days$ after discovery, or an off-axis relativistic jet directed far from our line of sight. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging provides the most direct way to distinguish between these scenarios. In this paper, we calculate synthetic radio images for both models and examine their observational signatures. The motion of the emission centroid is the most powerful diagnostic for breaking the degeneracy. In the delayed-outflow scenario, the centroid motion is confined within a non-relativistic distance, whereas in the off-axis jet scenario it exhibits apparent superluminal motion. Detecting such superluminal motion would therefore provide a smoking-gun signature of the off-axis jet interpretation. We also find that the jet image exhibits characteristic features, including a non-monotonic evolution of the image aspect ratio. These results are expected to be generic and applicable to other jetted explosions, such as microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.
#### The Effect of Magnetic Field Dissipation in the Inner Heliosheath: Reconciling Global Heliosphere Model and Voyager Data

 - **Abstract**
 Global ideal magnetohydrodynamic models of the heliosphere typically predict a greatly exaggerated magnetic field pile-up in the inner heliosheath (IHS), the region between the termination shock and heliopause. However, Voyager 1 and 2 observations show only a gradual increase throughout this region. This mismatch is largely attributed to the simplified assumption of a unipolar solar magnetic field in many global models, which neglects the complex, folded structure of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The IHS, especially at low heliolatitudes, contains these compressed sector boundaries, widely considered prime locations for magnetic dissipation via reconnection. To align global model simulations with observations without incurring the prohibitive computational cost of resolving the kinetic-scale current sheet, this work introduces a phenomenological term into the magnetic field induction equation. This term captures the macroscopic effect of magnetic energy dissipation due to unresolved HCS dynamics. It is designed to mitigate the artificial magnetic pile-up, preserve the topological integrity of the magnetic field lines, and avoid explicit magnetic diffusion. This study demonstrates that incorporating a phenomenological dissipation term into global heliospheric models helps to resolve the longstanding discrepancy between simulated and observed magnetic field profiles in the IHS. The proposed mechanism reduces exaggerated magnetic energy (converts it into thermal energy), aligns model output with Voyager measurements of both magnetic field and proton density, and produces the outward shift in termination shock position and a reduction of the IHS thickness. We found that the characteristic time for magnetic field dissipation of about 6 years provides improved agreement with Voyager data in the IHS.
#### The rotation curve of the Milky Way measured by Classical Cepheids from Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 We determine the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way in the range 6 < R < 18 kpc using a sample of 903 carefully selected classical Cepheids with precise proper motions and high-quality radial velocities from \emph{Gaia} DR3. Their distances can be accurately measured from the well-known Period-Wesenheit relations. The RC is computed from the three-dimensional velocity components of these Cepheids. Generally, the RC shows a slight decline with distance from the Galactic center. On top of this general trend, the newly constructed RC shows a dip around R ~ 10-11 kpc, followed by a bump around R ~ 13-14 kpc. This feature has also been reported in other RC measurements, mostly in RCs traced by young tracers like Cepheids. To better constrain the Milky Way mass, an averaged RC is then constructed by combining measurements from this work and previous efforts. Due to the ambiguous nature of the dip-and-bump feature, this averaged RC is constructed only within the radial range where the RC appears to be less influenced by this feature. By using this averaged RC, we determine the circular velocity at solar position and also build a parameterized mass model of our Milky Way. The result for the circular velocity at the solar position is $V_c(R_0) = 236.8 \pm 0.8\ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, which is in good agreement with previous measurements. The local dark matter density and the enclosed dark matter halo mass within 18 kpc are estimated from the averaged RC under different baryonic models, yielding a series of consistent results: a local density of $0.33-0.40\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and an enclosed mass of $1.19-1.45 \times 10^{11}\ M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar feedback is a crucial mechanism in galactic evolution, as demonstrated by the widespread bubbles observed with JWST. In this study, we combine data from Gaia and LAMOST to obtain a sample of young O-B2 stars with full three-dimensional velocity information. Focusing on the largest known superbubble in the Milky Way, we identify groups of O-B2 stars at its periphery, exhibiting a transverse velocity of 25.8 km/s and an expansion velocity of 6.2 km/s. Using these velocities, we calculate a crossing time t_cross ~ 20 Myr and an expansion timescale t_expansion ~ 80 Myr. We estimate a survival timescale t_survival ~ 250 Myr and a supernova interval t_SN ~ 0.1 Myr. Together with the Galactic shear timescale t_shear ~ 30 Myr, these values satisfy t_SN < t_shear < t_survival. The energy and momentum from supernovae are sufficient to sustain the bubble's growth against ambient pressure. This indicates that repeated supernovae replenish energy faster than shear and turbulent distort the cavity. Our analysis classifies the Giant Oval Cavity as a large, quasi-stationary superbubble, similar to the Phantom Bubble observed by JWST, stabilised by the interplay between stellar feedback and Galactic disk dynamics.
