 - **Abstract**
 In order to derive unbiased cosmological parameters from Stage-IV surveys, we need models that can predict the matter power spectrum for at least $k\,\lesssim\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with percent-level precision. The main challenge in this endeavour is that baryonic feedback significantly redistributes matter on large scales, but to an unknown degree. Here, we present an improved version of the "resummation" model, which maps observed halo baryon fractions of massive haloes ($M_{\mathrm{500c}}\gtrsim 10^{12.5}\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) to a flexible suppression signal - i.e. the ratio of baryonic to dark-matter-only (DMO) matter power spectra - using zero free parameters. We apply this model to the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, obtaining a typical precision of $\lesssim 1\%$ for $k\,\leq\,10\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$ given mean halo baryon fractions within the spherical overdensity radii $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{200m}}$. When only those within $R_{\mathrm{500c}}$ are available, we still obtain $\lesssim 2\%$ precision. We show that given small-scale stellar mass fractions, the model can be extended to yield $\lesssim 3\%$ precise suppression signals for all scales measured ($k\,\leq\,25\,h\mathrm{\,Mpc^{-1}}$). We also extend the model to redshifts $z>0$. Central to the model is a seemingly mass-independent and feedback-independent relation that allows observed halo masses to be mapped to equivalent DMO halo masses using only observed mean halo baryon fractions, to $\lesssim 1\%$ precision. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to retrieve the DMO halo mass function from observed halo masses and baryon fractions with percent-level precision, without any assumptions on the strength of feedback. A Python package implementing the resummation model is made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Boötes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff ($\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\rm M_\odot}$). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\pm0.25\%$ of Boötes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\approx -2.5$. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with $M \gtrsim 5~{\rm M_\odot}$ cannot constitute more than $\sim1\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.
#### The orbital anisotropy profile of the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus accretion remnant

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GS/E) accretion remnant is one of the most important stellar populations in the Milky Way halo. Recent simulation-based work has suggested that the anisotropy profiles of remnants like GS/E decline towards the center and may be well-fit by an Osipkov-Merritt-type distribution function (DF). We study the anisotropy profile of GS/E using a chemically-selected sample of stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia. We find that the anisotropy profile of GS/E is high and constant with $\beta \sim 0.9$ beyond 8 kpc, dropping to $\beta \sim 0.4$ at 2 kpc. We fit a two-component Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy profile to the GS/E data, finding that a combination of profiles with scale radii $r_{\mathrm{a}}=2$ kpc and 547 kpc, with a mixture fraction $k_\mathrm{om} = 0.88$ provide a better fit to the data than a constant anisotropy profile. Using this new DF, we re-assess the density profile and mass of the GS/E remnant from a previous work that assumed a contant-anisotropy DF, finding an increase in the derived mass from $1.5\times 10^{8}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to $2.29 ^{+0.95}_{-0.63}\times 10^{8}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In general, the combination Osipkov-Merritt DF more satisfactorily matches the kinematics of the GS/E remnant than the constant anisotropy DF, and in the future will form a more reliable basis for modelling the remnant. Additionally, these new constraints on the kinematics of GS/E near the Galactic center are an important measurement for any future theoretical or simulation-based investigation into its nature and origin.

 - **Abstract**
 We review our current understanding of nuclear stellar discs (NSDs), rotating, and flattened stellar structures found in the central regions of both early- and late-type galaxies. We examine their demographics, kinematics, stellar populations, metallicity gradients and star formation histories. We derive scaling relations linking NSDs to properties of their host galaxies, and compare them with analogous relations for nuclear star clusters. The relationship between NSDs and other central galactic components, including nuclear rings, nuclear bars, and nuclear star clusters, is explored. The role of NSDs as tracers of the secular evolution of barred galaxies is highlighted, emphasising how they can be used to constrain properties of galactic bars such as their ages. Special attention is given to the Milky Way's NSD, which serves as a unique case study thanks to its proximity and the ability to resolve individual stars. The review covers the Milky Way's NSD structure, kinematics, dynamics and stellar content, addressing ongoing debates about the presence of a nuclear bar and implications of the latter for central gas dynamics. We argue that NSDs form by in-situ star formation, most of them because of bar-driven gas inflow, but possibly in some cases because of external acquisition of gas during a gas-rich merger. The review concludes by outlining open questions, future research directions and the exciting prospects provided by upcoming observational facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the nearest low-metallicity dwarf galaxy. Its proximity and low reddening has enabled us to detect its Wolf-Rayet (WR) star population with 12 known objects. Quantitative spectroscopy of the stars revealed half of these WR stars to be strong sources of He ii ionizing flux, but the average metallicity of the SMC is below where WR bumps are usually detected in integrated galaxy spectra showing nebular He ii emission. Utilizing the Local Volume Mapper (LVM), we investigate regions around the six SMC WN3h stars, whose winds are thin enough to avoid He recombination and allow photons with > 54 eV to escape. Focusing on He ii 4686 Å, we show that the broad stellar wind component, the strongest optical diagnostic of the WN3h stars, is diluted within 24 pc in the integrated light from LVM, making the WR stars hard to detect in low-metallicity integrated regions. In addition, we compare the He ii ionizing flux from LVM with the values inferred from the stellar atmosphere code PoWR and find that the nebular emission around them only in some cases reflects the high amounts emitted by the stars. We conclude that early-type WN stars with comparably weak winds are viable sources to produce the observed He ii ionizing flux in low-metallicity galaxies. The easy dilution of the stellar signatures can explain the rareness of WR bump detections at 12 + log O/H < 8.0, while at the same time providing major candidates for the observed excess of nebular He ii emission. This constitutes a challenge for population synthesis models across all redshifts as the evolutionary path towards this observed WR population at low metallicity remains enigmatic.

 - **Abstract**
 As sites of some of the most efficient star formation in the Universe, globular clusters (GCs) have long been hypothesized to be the building blocks of young galaxies. Within the Milky Way, our best tracers of the contribution of GCs to the proto-Galaxy are stars with such anomalous overabundance in nitrogen and depletion in oxygen ("high-[N/O] stars") that they can be identified as having originated in a cluster long after they have escaped. We identify associations between these high-[N/O] field stars and GCs using integrals of motion and metallicities and compare to chemically typical halo stars to quantify any excess association, enabling a population-level exploration of the formation sites of the nitrogen-enhanced stars in the field. Relative to the halo as a whole, high-[N/O] stars show stronger associations with the most initially massive, inner Galaxy GCs, suggesting that many nitrogen-rich stars formed in these environments. However, when compared to a sample matched in orbital energy, the excess largely disappears: high-[N/O] stars are, on average, no more associated with surviving GCs than energy-matched halo stars, despite their [N/O] abundances indicating GC origins, consistent with a scenario in which a substantial fraction of low-energy inner-halo stars originate in GCs, so an energy-matched control dilutes any differential excess. We argue that associations between high-[N/O] stars and their parent GCs are further weakened because dynamical friction and the Galactic bar have altered integrals of motion, limiting the reliability of precise present-day associations and, especially, individual star-to-cluster tagging.
#### Survey of Profile Parameters of the $6196 Å$ Diffuse Interstellar Band. From Uniform Profiles to Doppler Splitting and Blueshifts

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse interstellar band (DIB) at 6196 A exhibits notable profile variations across the Milky Way. This study addresses three open issues: the unusual broadening of the DIB profile towards Upper Sco (USco), the lack of profile variations towards stars near $\eta$ Car, and the origin of the blueshift observed in Sco OB1. Using archival spectra of 453 early-type stars across the Galactic disk and in its proximity, we created a catalogue of the DIB's profile parameters. Our analysis identified Doppler-split components within the DIB profiles across most regions with no evidence for these splits being able to account for the observed broadening (23 km/s) in USco or other regions such as Orion, Vela OB2, and Melotte 20 ($\alpha$ Per cluster). We propose that neither the ages of the studied stellar populations nor the distances between clusters and nearby clouds significantly contribute to the broadening. However, we detect a gradient in the full width at half maximum within the Sco-Cen and Orion regions, where broadening decreases with distance from the star-forming centres. This result points to a possible connection between the DIB broadening and star formation (likely via the impact of recent supernovae). Regarding the Carina Nebula, we confirm the lack of DIB profile variations in a small region near $\eta$ Car, although an adjacent southern area exhibits significant variations, comparable to those in USco. In addition to the Carina Nebula, we find that the Rosette Nebula and NGC 6405 also show consistently narrow profiles (<20 km/s) with minimal deviations from the median over spatial scales of a few parsecs. Finally, regarding the origin of the blueshift observed in Sco OB1, we used a comparison with the Lagoon Nebula and argue that the most natural explanation is the presence of an unresolved kinematic component in the profile of the DIB, shifting the measured centre of the band.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the milliarcsecond localization of a high (1379 pc/cc) dispersion measure (DM) repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20190417A. Combining European VLBI Network detections of five repeat bursts, we confirm the FRB's host to be a low-metallicity, star-forming dwarf galaxy at z = 0.12817, analogous to the hosts of FRBs 20121102A, 20190520B and 20240114A. We also show that FRB 20190417A is spatially coincident with a compact, luminous persistent radio source (PRS). Visibility-domain model fitting constrains the transverse physical size of the PRS to < 23.1 pc and yields an integrated flux density of 191(39) microJy at 1.4 GHz. Though we do not find significant evidence for DM evolution, FRB 20190417A exhibits a time-variable rotation measure (RM) ranging between +3958(11) and +5061(24) rad/m2 over three years. We find no evidence for intervening galaxy clusters in the FRB's line-of-sight and place a conservative lower limit on the rest-frame host DM contribution of 1212.0 pc/cc (90% confidence) -- the largest known for any FRB so far. This system strengthens the emerging picture of a rare subclass of repeating FRBs with large and variable RMs, above-average host DMs, and luminous PRS counterparts in metal-poor dwarf galaxies. We explore the role of these systems in the broader FRB population, either as the youngest or most extreme FRB sources, or as a distinct engine for FRB emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a hybrid active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback model that features three accretion disc states (the thick, thin, and slim discs at low, moderate, and super-Eddington accretion rates, respectively), and two feedback modes: thermal isotropic and kinetic jets. The model includes black hole (BH) spin evolution due to gas accretion, BH mergers, jet spindown, and Lense-Thirring torques. The BH spin determines the jet directions and affects the feedback efficiencies. The model is implemented in the SWIFT code and coupled with the COLIBRE galaxy formation model. We present the first results from hybrid AGN feedback simulations run as part of the COLIBRE suite, focusing on the impact of new parameters and calibration efforts. Using the new hybrid AGN feedback model, we find that AGN feedback affects not just massive galaxies, but all galaxies down to $M_*\approx10^8$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$. BH spins are predicted to be near-maximal for intermediate-mass BHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}\in[10^6,10^8]$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), and lower for other BH masses. These trends are in good agreement with observations. The intergalactic medium is hotter and impacted on larger scales in the hybrid AGN feedback simulations compared to those using purely thermal feedback. In the hybrid AGN simulations, we predict that half of the cumulative injected AGN energy is in thermal and the other half in jet form, broadly independent of BH mass and redshift. Jet feedback is important at all redshifts and dominates over thermal feedback at $z<0.5$ and $z>1.5$, but only mildly.
