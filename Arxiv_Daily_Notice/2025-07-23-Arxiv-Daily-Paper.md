 - **Abstract**
 By comparing Cepheid brightnesses with geometric distance measures including Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, most recent analyses conclude metal-rich Cepheids are brighter, quantified as $\gamma \sim -0.2$ mag/dex. While the value of $\gamma$ has little impact on the determination of the Hubble constant in contemporary distance ladders (due to the similarity of metallicity across these ladders), $\gamma$ plays a role in gauging the distances to metal-poor dwarf galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds and is of considerable interest in testing stellar models. Recently, Madore & Freedman (2025, hereafter MF25) recalibrated Gaia EDR3 parallaxes by adding to them a magnitude offset to match certain historic Cepheid parallaxes which otherwise differ by $\sim1.6\sigma$. A calibration which adjusts Gaia parallaxes by applying a magnitude offset (i.e., a multiplicative correction in parallax) differs significantly from the Gaia Team's calibration (Lindegren et al. 2021), which is additive in parallax space - especially at distances much closer than 1 kpc or beyond 10 kpc, outside the $\sim$2-3 kpc range on which the MF25 calibration was based. The MF25 approach reduces $\gamma$ to zero. If extrapolated, it places nearby cluster distances like the Pleiades too close compared to independent measurements, while leaving distant quasars with negative parallaxes. Further, by shortening the Milky Way distance scale, the MF25 calibration raises the local Hubble constant by $\sim$1 km/s/Mpc, increasing the Hubble tension significantly. We conclude that the MF25 proposal for Gaia calibration and $\gamma \sim 0$ produces farther-reaching consequences, many of which are strongly disfavored by the data.
#### Measuring and modelling the Splash with APOGEE/Gaia and ARTEMIS

 - **Abstract**
 Using combined data from SDSS-IV/APOGEE and Gaia, we study the chemo-dynamical properties of the Splash population in comparison with those of the high-alpha disc. We investigate a wide range of abundance ratios, finding that the Splash differs from the high-alpha disc overall. However, these differences result from a smooth variation of chemical compositions as a function of orbital properties. The Splash occupies the high-alpha, high-[Al,K/Fe], and low-[Mn/Fe] end of the high-alpha disk population. In agreement with previous studies, we find that Splash stars are distributed over large heights from the Galactic mid-plane. To further elucidate the relation between the Splash and the high-alpha disk, we turn to simulations. Using a sample of Milky Way-like galaxies with and without major accretion events from the ARTEMIS simulations, we find that Splash-like populations are ubiquitous, though not always resulting from major mergers. Lower mass progenitors can also generate Splash-like features, as long as they are on retrograde orbits. Moreover, we find a strong correlation between the mass fraction of Splash stars and the fraction of retrograde accreted stars in the disk. Some galaxies with minor (retrograde) mergers contain more pronounced Splash populations than others with major, but prograde, mergers. For stars in the high-alpha disks, we also find a decrease in the [alpha/Fe] with increasing orbital angular momentum. This trend is found in hosts with both major or minor mergers. Our results suggest that a number of relatively low-mass mergers on retrograde orbits could result in populations that are qualitatively similar to the Splash.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifications of red supergiants (RSGs) in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies have experienced an exponential increase in recent years, driven by advancements in selection techniques, the continued expansion of archival datasets, and a steady increase in spectroscopic data. This review describes the advances in methodologies and selection criteria for identifying RSGs and presents the current census of these stars in our own Galaxy and nearby galaxies. It also describes the insights gained from resolving nearby RSGs and their complex circumstellar material in the Milky Way and from the growing samples of RSGs being discovered in the Local Group and beyond. These advances impact the Humphreys--Davidson limit in the cool part of the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. Furthermore, they provide insight into extreme RSGs and the role of photometric variability and, in particular, of the newly discovered phenomenon of dimming events. Recent observations have enabled the determination of the binarity fraction among RSGs, offering new constraints to stellar evolution. Looking ahead, the synergy between large-scale surveys, high-resolution observations, and emerging machine-learning tools promises to further transform our understanding of the final evolutionary stages of massive stars in the coming decade.

 - **Abstract**
 The discrepancy between the early-time estimation and late-time observation on the cosmic baryon content - the 'missing baryon problem' - is a longstanding problem in cosmology. Although recent studies with fast radio bursts (FRBs) have largely addressed this discrepancy, the precise spatial distribution of these baryons remains uncertain due to the effect of galaxy feedback. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Simba have shown that the partitioning of baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes is sensitive to feedback models, motivating the connection of baryon distribution with feedback physics. With the Simba simulation suite, this study investigates how feedback affects the distribution of matter within large-scale cosmic structures, with implications for FRB foreground modeling. We apply the T-web method to classify the cosmic web into different structures: knots, filaments, sheets, and voids. We then analyze how the different feedback variants of Simba affect the distribution of matter within each structure. Our results show that in Simba, the fractions of IGM gas in different cosmic web structures vary only a few percent under different feedback models. However, jet feedback produces noticeable changes in the gas distribution within structures, enhancing the diffuse IGM on the outskirts of filaments and knots. This research provides a new perspective on the impact of feedback on the IGM and motivates a refined data model for the FRB foreground mapping.

 - **Abstract**
 We extend our super-resolution and emulation framework for cosmological dark matter simulations to include hydrodynamics. We present a two-stage deep learning model to emulate high-resolution (HR-HydroSim) baryonic fields from low-resolution (LR-HydroSim) simulations at redshift $z = 3$. The method takes as inputs an LR-HydroSim and the high-resolution initial conditions (HR-HydroICs). First, the model stochastically generates high-resolution baryonic fields from the LR-HydroSim. Second, a deterministic emulator refines these fields using HR-HydroICs to reconstruct small-scale structures including displacement, velocity, internal energy, and gas/star classification. Trained on paired low- and high-resolution simulations produced with \texttt{MP-Gadget}, the model captures small-scale structures of the intergalactic medium and %Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables down to the 100 kpc pressure smoothing scale relevant to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The model achieves subpercent error for overdensity, temperature, velocity, and optical depth fields, a mean relative error of 1.07\% in the large-scale flux power spectrum (\(k < 3 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{s/km}\)), and less than 10\% error in the flux probability distribution function. Notably, the two-stage model reduces the compute time by a factor of $\sim$450 compared to full smoothed particle hydrodynamics at the same resolution. This work demonstrates the potential of this framework as a powerful and efficient tool for generating high-resolution fields offering fast and accurate alternatives to traditional cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and enabling large-volume mock datasets for next-generation cosmological surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The timing of cosmic reionization across Local Group (LG) analogues provides insights into their early histories and surrounding large-scale structure. Using the radiation-hydrodynamic simulation THESAN-1 and its dark matter-only counterpart THESAN-DARK-1, we track the reionization histories of all haloes, including 224 LG analogues within the proximity of any of the 20 Virgo-like clusters with halo masses above 10^14 Msun at z=0 and their environments. The statistically controlled samples quantify how the reionization redshift (z_reion) correlates with halo mass, local overdensity, and present-day pair properties. Even at fixed mass, haloes in denser regions ionize earlier, and increasing the overdensity smoothing scale systematically suppresses small-scale structure, including local variations and environmental gradients in z_reion. Virgo-like clusters accelerate reionization in their surroundings out to ~5-10 cMpc, beyond which local overdensity again becomes the dominant factor. Within LG pairs, reionization timing offsets reach up to ~150 Myr and correlate with present-day halo separation, reflecting sensitivity to large-scale structure rather than mass ratio in driving asynchronous reionization. The results support an extreme inside-out picture where clustered sources rapidly ionize their immediate neighborhoods, while lower-density regions self-ionize later and voids wait for external homogenization. These links between environment and reionization timing explain the influence of protoclusters and help interpret fossil records in LG dwarfs around the Milky Way. For Milky Way analogues, we find a reionization redshift as early (late) as z_reion = 12.7^{+2.0}_{-1.7} (8.88^{+0.66}_{-0.70}) when considered on 125 ckpc (500 ckpc) scales, with LG analogues following an inside-out reionization picture.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the utility of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as novel observational probes to constrain models of interacting dark energy (IDE). By leveraging FRB dispersion measures (DMs) and redshifts, we perform a comprehensive analysis of three IDE models: gamma_m IDE, gamma_x IDE, and xi IDE, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods based on 86 localized FRBs and simulated datasets containing 2500 to 10000 mock events. By disentangling the contributions to the observed DMs from the Milky Way, host galaxies, and the intergalactic medium (IGM), key cosmological parameters are constrained, including the Hubble constant (H0), matter density (Omega_m), the dark energy equation of state (omega_x), and interaction strengths (gamma_m, gamma_x, xi). The best-fit values of the gamma_m IDE model indicate a potential alleviation of the cosmic coincidence problem. Subsequently, we utilize information criteria (IC) to conduct a comparative assessment of the three IDE models. When applied to the current sample of observed FRBs, the xi IDE model yields slightly lower IC values than the gamma_m IDE and gamma_x IDE models across all three criteria, although the differences are not statistically significant. These results underscore the value of FRB measurements as complementary probes that provide further constraints on alternative cosmological models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory has published properties of the 100 highest-energy cosmic ray events (to energies above 100 EeV) which it recorded over a 17 year period. We have examined the directional properties of these events and have taken particular note of the most energetically extreme events. We find that the most energetic events have directions which are grouped in a non-random way at the 1\% level. There is an apparent clustering in a limited region of the sky. Close to that direction is found Centaurus A, which has long been considered as a source of such particles, but we also note that a close-by dwarf galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is closer in angular terms. We examine the possibility that the LMC might be a source of observed cosmic rays at the highest energies.

 - **Abstract**
 Grid type pre-initial conditions are commonly used to initialize particle positions in cosmological simulations. While these conditions are known to produce noticeable numerical artifacts in void regions, their impact on halo properties has generally been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we employ multiple simulations to demonstrate that grid initialization induces statistically significant artifacts in halo shapes, despite the modest absolute amplitude ($\sim 1\%$) making them unimportant for most cosmological studies. We identify a redshift-dependent artificial alignment pattern: at low redshifts ($z<2$), halo shapes preferentially orient away from the simulation box's Cartesian axes, whereas their constituent particles initially exhibit alignment with these axes. We propose a mathematical hypothesis to explain this flipping behavior.
#### Discovery of SiC and Iron Dust Around AGB Stars in the very Metal-Poor Sextans A Dwarf Galaxy with JWST: Implications for Dust Production at High Redshift

 - **Abstract**
 Low-resolution infrared spectroscopy from JWST confirms the presence of SiC and likely metallic iron dust around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Sextans A dwarf galaxy, which has a metallicity ~1%-7% Z_sun. While metal-poor carbon-rich AGB stars are known to produce copious amounts of amorphous carbon dust owing to the dredge up of newly synthesized carbon, this is the first time that Si- and Fe-bearing dust has been detected at this extreme metallicity. Of the six AGB stars observed, one is an intermediate-mass (~1.2-4 M_sun) carbon star showing SiC dust, and another is an oxygen-rich M-type star with mass ~4-5 M_sun that is likely undergoing hot bottom burning. The infrared excess of the M-type star is strong, but featureless. We tested multiple dust species, and find that it is best fit with metallic iron dust. Assuming its dust-production rate stays constant over the final 2-3x10^4 yr of its evolution, this star will produce ~0.9-3.7 times the iron dust mass predicted by models, with the range depending on the adopted stellar mass. The implications for dust production in high-redshift galaxies are potentially significant, especially regarding the assumed dust species used in dust evolution models and the timescale of AGB dust formation. Stars on the upper end of the AGB mass range can begin producing dust as early as 30-50 Myr after they form, and they may therefore rival dust production by supernovae at high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Low redshift fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide robust measurements of the host-galaxy contribution to the dispersion measure (DM), which can constrain the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the hosts. We curate a sample of 20 nearby FRBs with low scattering timescales and face-on host galaxies with stellar masses ranging from $10^9 < M^* / M_\odot < 10^{11}$. We fit the distribution of the host galaxy DM to a quadratic model as a function of stellar mass with a mass-independent scatter and find that the more massive the host, the lower its host DM. We report that this relation has a negative slope of $m = -97 \pm 44$ pc/cm$^{-3}$ per dex in stellar mass. We compare this measurement to similar fits to three sub-grid models implemented in the CAMELS suite of simulations from Astrid, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA and find that fine-tuning of the host ISM contribution as a function of stellar mass is required in order to reconcile the observational data with the predictions of the fiducial CAMELS-Astrid model. More generally, models which attribute a positive correlation between stellar mass and host dispersion measure ($m > 0$) to the CGM are in tension with our measurement. We show that this conclusion is robust to a wide range of assumptions, such as the offset distribution of FRBs from their hosts and the statistics of the cosmic contribution to the DM budget along each sightline. Our results indirectly imply a lower limit on the strength of baryonic feedback in the Local Universe $(z < 0.2)$ in isolated $\sim L^*$ halos, complementing results from weak lensing surveys and kSZ observations which target higher halo mass and redshift ranges.
