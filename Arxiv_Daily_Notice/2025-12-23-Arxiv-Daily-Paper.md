 - **Abstract**
 Spiral arms are the defining features of broad morphological classes of disc galaxies, but their nature and influence on galaxy evolution is still under debate. A key diagnostic for their nature is the spiral arm pattern speed: the radial profile of the angular rotation rate of spiral features. This profile determines the location and number of dynamical resonances where peculiar motions and azimuthal metallicity fluctuations in stars and gas can manifest; their precise patterns have the potential to support or reject theories of spiral structure. However, limited observations of this type have been carried out so far, despite an increasing number of theoretical predictions emerging from realistic and detailed cosmological simulations. A systematic observational programme focussed on the resolved kinematics and metallicities of stellar populations around galaxy spiral arms is required to confront these predictions. This calls for wide-area multi-object spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes capable of accurately capturing such data across the full coverage of spiral arms in nearby galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal warm dark matter (WDM) particles with $m_{\rm WDM} \leq 1~\mathrm{keV}$ are ruled out at more than $4\sigma$ by multiple observational probes, owing to the strong suppression of small-scale structure induced by early-time free-streaming. Recently, it was highlighted that a small admixture of $\sim1\%$ ($f_{\rm CDM} \sim\!0.01$) cold dark matter (CDM) endowed with a blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum could offset the WDM-induced suppression and relax the WDM mass bound by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10)$. If viable, this ''warm + cold-isocurvature'' scenario would allow sub-keV WDM particles to constitute nearly the full dark matter abundance while potentially alleviating some small-scale tensions. In this work, we test this mechanism by constraining the WDM mass $m_{\rm WDM}$ while marginalizing over CDM isocurvature parameters. We combine ultraviolet luminosity function measurements from the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} over redshift $4 \leq z \leq 11$ with CMB, BAO, and SNe data. For a pure WDM model, our joint analysis yields a lower bound $m_{\rm WDM} > 1.8~\mathrm{keV}$ (95% credible intervals). When CDM isocurvature is introduced at $f_{\rm CDM} = 0.01$, the limit relaxes to $m_{\rm WDM} > 0.27~\mathrm{keV}$ (95% credible intervals), reflecting a shallow degeneracy in which blue-tilted isocurvature fluctuations partially compensate for WDM suppression. These results provide new constraints on thermal WDM in the presence of CDM isocurvature fluctuations and quantify the extent to which such fluctuations can mask the small-scale signatures of light relics.
#### The AURORA Survey: The Mass -- Metallicity and Fundamental Metallicity Relations at $z \sim 2.3$ Based Purely on Direct $T_e$ Metallicities

 - **Abstract**
 We present new constraints on the Mass -- Metallicity (MZR) and Fundamental Metallicity Relations (FMR) using a sample of 34 galaxies at $1.38\leq~z\leq~3.5$ (median $z=2.28$). These galaxies have direct $T_e$ measurements from [O\sc{iii}]4363Å~and/or [O\sc{ii}]7320,7331Å~auroral emission lines detected with \textit{JWST}/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey. The detection of both oxygen auroral lines allows for dual-zone direct $T_e$ measurements and expands the dynamic range in $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)}$ (7.68 to 8.65 dex), stellar mass ($10^{8}$ to $10^{10.4}$ M$_\odot$), and star-formation rate ($1$ to $100$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) compared to previous direct $T_e$ studies of the high-redshift MZR and FMR. We characterize the $z\sim2$ MZR and find a slope of $0.27\pm0.04$ and normalization of $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)} = 8.44\pm0.04$ at $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ with an intrinsic scatter of 0.10 dex, consistent with past strong-line MZR measurements. Comparisons with $z\sim2$ predictions from six simulations reveal that none reproduce our observed MZR normalization evolution between $z\sim0$ and $z\sim2$. This discrepancy suggests current models do not fully capture the chemical enrichment and feedback processes occurring at cosmic noon. However, all 34 galaxies are on or above the star-forming main sequence such that our sample may be biased towards lower $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)}$ if the FMR persists at $z\sim2$. Correcting for this selection effect would increase O/H by $\approx0.1$ dex at 10$^{9.3}$ M$_\odot$ (the median mass of our sample) bringing our MZR into better agreement with that of \texttt{TNG}. Lastly, we find our $z\sim2.3$ sample is consistent with the $z\sim0$ FMR within 0.1 dex in O/H, indicating that the smooth secular mechanisms regulating chemical enrichment, star formation, stellar mass, and outflows were in place at cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fundamental to cosmology and galactic chemical evolution, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains unresolved. Multiple evolutionary pathways, including single-degenerate, double-degenerate, and helium-donor systems, are thought to contribute to the SN Ia population, but direct observational constraints are limited. This uncertainty hampers our understanding of SN Ia diversity and introduces systematic uncertainties in their use as precision cosmological probes. By the 2040s, surveys such as Gaia, LSST, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and the gravitational-wave mission LISA will identify thousands of compact binaries in the Milky Way that are potential SN Ia progenitors. However, survey discoveries alone are insufficient. Robust identification and characterization require high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy to determine fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital inclinations, chemical compositions, and accretion states. Addressing these challenges demands new observational capabilities. The most compact binaries require continuous, dead-time-free spectroscopy with negligible readout noise, while the progenitor population spans a wide range of brightness and orbital periods. A modular, multi-aperture telescope array equipped with fast, low-noise spectrographs can flexibly combine collecting area for faint targets, observe bright systems efficiently, and deliver uninterrupted time series through staggered exposures. Such observations are difficult for single-aperture facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Free-streaming of cosmic neutrinos impacts the distribution and growth of cosmic structures on small scales, allowing constraints on the sum of neutrino masses $M_\nu$ from clustering studies. In this work, we investigate for the first time the possibility of disentangling massive neutrino cosmologies with the 3-point correlation function (3PCF). We measure the isotropic connected 3PCF $\zeta$ and the reduced 3PCF $Q$ of halo catalogues from the Quijote suite of N-body simulations, considering $M_\nu =0.0, 0.1, 0.2,$ and $0.4 \, \mathrm{eV}$ in different redshift bins. We develop a framework to quantify the detectability of massive neutrinos for different triangle configurations and shapes, and apply it to a case compatible with a Stage-IV spectroscopic survey. We also compare our results with the analysis of simulations without neutrinos, but with different $\sigma_8$ values, to test whether the 3PCF can break the well-known degeneracy between the two parameters. We find that, as a result of free-streaming, the largest signal is found for quasi-isosceles and squeezed triangles; this signal is increasing for decreasing redshifts. Among these configurations, elongated triangles, tracing the filamentary structure of the cosmic web, are the most affected by the impact of massive neutrinos, with a 3PCF signal increasing with $M_\nu$. A complementary source of signal comes from right-angled triangles in $Q$. Importantly, we find that the signatures of a $\sigma_8$ variation appear significantly different on elongated triangles in $\zeta$ and right-angled triangles in $Q$, suggesting that the 3PCF can be used to effectively break the $M_\nu - \sigma_8$ degeneracy. These results open the possibility to use the 3PCF as a powerful complementary tool to constrain neutrino masses in current and future spectroscopic surveys like DESI, Euclid, 4MOST, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 We infer the ages of three young stellar clusters, NGC 2004, NGC 7419, and NGC 2100, using Stellar Ages, a statistical algorithm designed to infer stellar population properties from color magnitude diagrams. Recent studies have revealed emerging inconsistencies in the inferred ages of very young stellar clusters with ages less than or equal to 50 Myr. Here, we identify and quantify two distinct discrepancies. First, we identify a systematic age offset of 0.55 plus minus 0.09 dex between red supergiant and bright blue star age estimates, equivalent to a factor of approximately 3.5 in linear age, with bright blue star ages appearing systematically younger than those inferred from red supergiants. Second, given the observed numbers of red supergiants and bright blue stars, we find a pronounced deficit of lower-mass main-sequence stars relative to expectations from a standard initial mass function. Although these discrepancies resemble those reported for intermediate-age clusters, their magnitude and character suggest that they are unique to the evolution of massive stars. Together, these results highlight population-level inconsistencies with single-star evolutionary models and underscore the need to consider multiple evolutionary tracers when age-dating young clusters. By combining individual stellar ages with population-wide constraints, our approach refines prior work on cluster age determinations and provides new insight into massive star evolution and the interpretation of cluster demographics.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs), densely packed collections of thousands to millions of old stars, are excellent tracers of their host galaxies' evolutionary histories. Traditional methods for identifying GCs in galaxies rely on cuts over photometric catalogs and can yield source lists with high levels of contamination from compact background galaxies and foreground stars. In an era when large-scale sky surveys produce photometry for millions of sources, it is essential to employ flexible and scalable tools to reliably identify GCs in external galaxies. To prepare for surveys like Rubin/LSST, we need to explore practical methodological improvements and quantify the limitations inherent in the datasets. This paper investigates the selection of point-like extragalactic GCs exclusively in the $ugrizY$ color space. We use archival data to assemble an LSST-like photometric catalog for the Fornax Cluster containing labeled spectroscopically confirmed GCs, galaxies, and stars. From this catalog, using principal component analysis and non-linear auto-encoders (AEs), we construct inputs to random forest and multi-layer perceptron classifiers. We show that selecting GCs using ugrizY colors can lead to contamination rates of ~ 45%. If the principal components of the colors are used instead, this rate reduces to ~ 35% without increasing incompleteness. The AEs did not improve GC identification. To further reduce contamination and extract the full potential of LSST for star cluster studies, we argue for the need to augment photometric information with ancillary data (morphology from space-based missions and near-infrared photometry) before attempting to leverage more complex models.
#### Interpreting the strong clustering of ultra-diffuse galaxies by halo spin bias

 - **Abstract**
 We use the IllustrisTNG300-ODM simulation to investigate the spin bias of low-mass halos and its connection to the strong clustering of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) reported by Zhang et al. (2025). By comparing two halo spin definitions-one using only bound particles ($\lambda_{\rm b}$) and another including unbound particles ($\lambda_{\rm a}$)-we demonstrate that the spin bias of low-mass halos critically depends on the definition. While $\lambda_{\rm a}$ yields stronger clustering for higher-spin halos at all masses, $\lambda_{\rm b}$ produces an inverted trend below $M_{\rm h}\sim 10^{11} \rm M_{\odot}/h$. This discrepancy is driven by a subset of halos in high-density environments that have large $\lambda_{\rm a}$ but small $\lambda_{\rm b}$. Using an empirical model implemented in SDSS-like mocks, we link the stellar surface-mass-density ($\Sigma_\ast$) of a galaxy to $\lambda_{\rm a}$ of its host halo and find an anti-correlation that more diffuse dwarfs tend to reside in higher-spin halos. The model naturally reproduces the observed strong clustering of UDGs within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework without invoking exotic assumptions such as self-interacting dark matter. The high fraction of unbound particles in UDG hosts likely originates from tidal fields in dense regions, an effect particularly significant for low-mass halos. We discuss how the angular momentum of a halo represented by $\lambda_{\rm a}$ may be transferred to the gas to affect size and surface density of the galaxy that forms in the halo.
#### Magnetic field spreading from stellar and galactic dynamos into the exterior

 - **Abstract**
 The exteriors of stellar and galactic dynamos are usually modeled as a current-free potential field. A more realistic description might be that of a force-free magnetic field. Here, we suggest that, in the absence of outflows, neither of those reflect the actual behavior when the magnetic field spreads diffusively into a more poorly conducting turbulent exterior outside dynamo. In particular, we show that the usual ordering of the dipole magnetic field being the most slowly decaying one is altered, and that the quadrupole can develop a toroidal component that decays even more slowly with radial distance. This behavior is best seen for spherical dynamo volumes and becomes more complicated for oblate ones. In either case, however, those fields are confined within a magnetosphere beyond which the field drops exponentially. The magnetosphere expands ballistically (i.e., linearly in time $t$) during the exponential growth phase of the dynamo, but diffusively proportional to $t^{1/2}$ during the saturated phase. We demonstrate that the Faraday displacement current, which plays a role in a vacuum, can safely be neglected in all cases. For quadrupolar configurations, the synchrotron emission from the magnetosphere is found to be constant along concentric rings. The total and the polarized radio emissions from the dipolar or the quadrupolar configurations display large scale radial trends that are potentially distinguishable with existing radio telescopes. The superposition of magnetic fields from galaxies in the outskirts of the voids between galaxy clusters can therefore not explain the void magnetization of the intergalactic medium, reinforcing the conventional expectation that those fields are of primordial origin.
