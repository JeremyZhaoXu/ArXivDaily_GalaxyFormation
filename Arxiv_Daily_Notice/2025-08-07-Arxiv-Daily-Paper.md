#### Warm Dark Matter meets Cold Dark Matter Isocurvature
 - **Authors:** Sai Chaitanya Tadepalli, Tomo Takahashi

 - **Abstract**
 Isocurvature fluctuations can be generated in various scenarios in the early Universe. In particular, some specific models predict those with a blue-tilted spectrum, which is consistent with the constraints from cosmic microwave background such as Planck, although isocurvature fluctuations with an almost scale-invariant spectrum are severely constrained. We argue that cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature fluctuations with blue-tilted spectrum are not only consistent with current cosmological data, but also can loosen the bound on the masses of warm dark matter (WDM), which suppresses small-scale power. In pure thermal WDM models with the adiabatic initial condition, a combination of the data from Lyman-$\alpha$, gravitational lensing, and Milky Way satellites gives a lower bound on the WDM mass as $6~{\rm keV}$ at $95\%$ C.L. while mixed WDM+CDM models loosen these bounds to $m_{\rm WDM}\sim1$ keV for a warm-fraction $f_{\rm WDM}\lesssim0.14$ and $m_{\rm WDM}\sim600$ eV for $f_{\rm WDM}\lesssim0.08$. On the other hand, as we demonstrate, WDM scenarios with a blue-tilted CDM isocurvature power spectrum, even with only $1\%$ CDM contribution ($f_{\rm WDM}\sim0.99$), can allow WDM masses as low as $600$ eV. We further assess the implications of this ``warm + cold-isocurvature'' extension for the small-scale structure by performing $N$-body simulations, particularly focusing on nonlinear matter power spectrum and halo mass function.
#### Scaling Relations for Dark Matter Halos Hosting Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the extraction of parameters of dark matter halos hosting ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, in the case where there are only ${\cal O}(10)$ identified member stars with measured line-of-sight velocities. This scenario is likely to be increasingly common, as upcoming newly discovered dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way, by e.g. the Rubin Observatory, will likely (at least initially) have only a few identified members. Assuming an NFW dark matter profile, equilibrium modeling likely can only robustly extract one halo parameter ($\rho_s r_s$), but the scale radius itself will typically be unconstrained. In these cases, the results obtainable from Jeans modeling can be well replicated by a simple scaling relation motivated by the half-light mass estimator. As a application, we examine the recently discovered stellar system Ursa Major III, which has been optimistically assessed to have the largest $J$-factor of any known object. We suggest that, because of the presence of outlier stars, the $J$-factor obtained from modeling of Ursa Major III is likely inflated, as it is inconsistent with the half-light mass estimator, while removal of the outliers will leave the $J$-factor unconstrained from below.
#### LAP1-B is the First Observed System Consistent with Theoretical Predictions for Population III Stars
 - **Authors:** Eli Visbal, Ryan Hazlett, Greg L. Bryan
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03842

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03842

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Nakajima et al. (2025) presented James Webb Space Telescope observations of the $z=6.6$ Population III (Pop III) candidate LAP1-B, which is gravitationally lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416. We argue that this is the first object to agree with three key theoretical predictions for Pop III stars: (1) formation in extremely low-metallicity halos with virial temperatures ranging from $T_{\rm vir}\sim 10^3-10^4~{\rm K}$, (2) a top-heavy initial mass function, and (3) formation of low-mass clusters with ${\sim}{\rm a ~few}\times 1000~M_\odot$ in massive Pop III stars. LAP1-B is consistent with recently formed Pop III stars hosted in a $\sim 5\times 10^7~M_\odot$ dark matter halo, some of which have enriched their surrounding gas either with supernovae or stellar winds. We use the semi-analytic model of Visbal et al. (2020) to predict the abundance of Pop III clusters observable at the high magnification provided by the foreground galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Using fiducial parameters unmodified from previous work, we expect about one observable Pop III galaxy similar to LAP1-B in the range $z=6-7$. At earlier times, the intrinsic abundance is higher, but Pop III systems would not have been detected because of their increased luminosity distance and lower mass dark matter halos, which would host fewer stars. Thus, we find that LAP1-B was found at the redshift theoretically expected, given current observable limits, despite the fact that most Pop III systems form much earlier.
#### Synthesizer: a Software Package for Synthetic Astronomical Observables

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03888

 - **Abstract**
 We present Synthesizer, a fast, flexible, modular and extensible platform for modelling synthetic astrophysical observables. Synthesizer can be used for a number of applications, but is predominantly designed for generating mock observables from analytical and numerical galaxy formation simulations. These use cases include (but are not limited to) analytical modelling of the star formation and metal enrichment histories of galaxies, the creation of mock images and integral field unit observations from particle based simulations, detailed photoionisation modelling of the central regions of active galactic nuclei, and spectro-photometric fitting. We provide a number of stellar population synthesis models, photoionisation code configurations, dust models, and imaging configurations that can be used 'out-of-the-box' interactively. We invite and encourage the community to use, test and develop the code, and hope that the foundation developed will provide a flexible framework for a number of tasks in forward and inverse modelling of astrophysical observables.
#### Utilizing Maximum Variability to Discern TDE Emission from AGN Flares

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03889

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03889

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray emission arising from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity may potentially mimic the expected emission of Tidal disruption events (TDEs). Ongoing and upcoming wide-field X-ray surveys will detect thousands of TDE-like sources, and classifying them securely as TDEs or AGNs is a challenging task. To this aim, we measure the average X-ray variability of AGNs and derive a threshold of maximum variation as a function of time separating the TDEs from AGN flares. For the comparison between TDE and AGN X-ray variability, we cross-match the publicly available XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT point source catalogs with the Million Quasars Catalog and optically selected TDEs. Then we compute the X-ray structure function (SF) and maximum variability of the AGN and TDE samples. The X-ray SF of AGNs has a power-law index $\gamma\sim0.11-0.14$ when fitted with a simple power-law model. However, the SF of AGNs is best described by a broken power-law or a power exponential model with a damping time scale $\tau=950\pm300$ days. The maximum variability comparison between TDE and simulated AGN light curves indicates they have a similar order of variation on a time scale of less than 20 days. However, at a longer time scale of ~20 days or more, the large-scale variations expected from power-law-like decay in TDEs become less frequent in AGNs. Furthermore, we compare the maximum variability of eROSITA TDE candidates with AGN, finding that many of the eROSITA-DE TDE candidates are consistent with flares from AGNs, and may not be TDEs.
#### When Stars Mimic Monsters: Luminous Blue Variables in SBS 0335-052 E

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have claimed the detection of an active massive black hole (BH) in the low-metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxy SBS 0335-052 E based on near-infrared (NIR) time variability and broad H$\alpha$ wings. This interpretation remains questionable given the observed broad wings in forbidden [O III] emission. Based on spectroscopic properties derived from our KCWI/KCRM integral-field observation of super star clusters 1 and 2 (SSCs 1$\&$2), we propose instead that these BH signatures originate from a luminous blue variable (LBV) outburst in a binary system like $\eta$ Carinae. First, the [Fe II] emission-line ratio and detected O I 8446 pumped emission require high-density gas ($n_e \sim 10^6$ $\rm{cm^{-3}}$). This dense gas resides in the circumstellar medium (CSM) formed by pre-outburst stellar winds. Subsequent shock interaction between the LBV outburst ejecta and CSM efficiently produces warm dust and the corresponding NIR excess. Second, SSCs 1$\&$2 are nitrogen-enriched relative to other SSCs. This enrichment arises from ejections of CNO-cycled material by multiple LBV outbursts. Third, we detect asymmetric broad H$\alpha$ wings extending from $\sim -5\,000$ to $\sim 10\,000\ \rm{km\,s^{-1}}$. This asymmetry results from electron scattering in the expanding, optically thick CSM. The proposed CSM shock interaction naturally explains the luminosities of [Fe V] and ultra-luminous X-ray emission. Contrarily, [Fe II] and [Fe IV] emission originates primarily from gas photoionized by the cool primary LBV and hot secondary stars, respectively. Our results highlight how the shock interaction of massive stars with high-density CSM mimics active massive BH signatures in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies.
#### The Milky Way and M31 rotation curves in Yukawa gravity: phenomenology and Bayesian analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Yukawa gravity provides a generalized framework for modeling gravity modification. We investigate the rotation curve profiles of spiral galaxies under Yukawa-like theories governed by the coupling strength $\beta$ and the interaction range $\lambda$. We develop a unified analytical and numerical framework to calculate rotational velocities under Yukawa gravity, which includes contributions from all major galactic components: stellar bulge, disk, dark matter (DM) halo, and central supermassive black hole. The calculations show that $\beta$ and $\lambda$ strongly influence velocity distributions, shifting peaks, creating double-peak structures, or enhancing dark matter dominance in the bulge or disk. To assess observational implications, we perform Bayesian analyses using data from the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31), which offer complementary characteristics: MW provides precise velocity profiles across multiple scales, while M31 includes broader morphological constraints. We examine four scenarios: Yukawa gravity without dark matter, dark matter with non-trivial coupling, fully modified gravity, and standard Newtonian gravity. Results show that MW models with $\lambda < 1$ kpc yield high Bayes factors but risk overfitting, as dark matter mimics baryonic kinematics, while M31's photometric priors from conjugate observations mitigate this, yielding robust parameter estimates. However, in M31, Bayes factors favor Newtonian gravity, suggesting that current data lack the precision to resolve more complex models. This finding highlights two key needs: (i) realistic, physically or empirically informed priors to avoid biased constraints, and (ii) high-precision data with independent photometry to guard against overfitting. Our framework offers a scalable approach for testing gravity with large galactic rotation curve datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars that contain only trace amounts of elements heavier than helium, referred to as having low "metallicity", preserve the chemical fingerprints of the first generation of stars and supernovae. In the Milky Way, the lowest metallicity stars show an extreme over-abundance of carbon relative to other elements, which has been hypothesized to be a unique result of the first low-energy supernovae. However, the origin of this signature has remained a mystery, since no such stars have been discovered in the ancient dwarf galaxies where they are thought to have formed. Here, we present observations of a star in the >10 billion year old ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Pictor II, that shows the lowest iron and calcium abundances outside the Milky Way (<1/43,000th solar and ~1/160,000th solar), with a factor of >3000x relative carbon enhancement. As the first unambiguous second-generation star in a relic dwarf galaxy, this object demonstrates that carbon-enhanced second-generation stars can originate in primordial small-scale systems. This star supports the hypothesis that carbon-enhancement is produced by low-energy-supernovae, since the yields of energetic supernovae are harder to retain in small-scale environments. This key local signature of chemical enrichment by the first stars traces a regime inaccessible to current high-redshift observations, which cannot detect the early enrichment of the smallest galaxies.
#### Probing the Type 3 interacting dark-energy model using matter pairwise velocity

 - **Abstract**
 Dark sector interactions can be explored via the so-called Type 3 model where dark matter and dark energy exchange momentum only, so as to minimize deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history. Using N-body simulations, we analyze the imprint of Type 3 model parameters, the momentum exchange coupling constant $\beta$ and the slope of scalar field potential $\lambda$, on large-scale structure (LSS) observables, particularly the matter pairwise velocity statistics. We find that the effects of $\beta$ ($< 0$) and $\lambda$ on the mean matter peculiar pairwise velocity and velocity dispersion are degenerate. Our results highlight the potential of velocity statistics as a probe of dark sector interactions and underscore the importance of disentangling $\beta$ and $\lambda$ in cosmological analyses.
#### Probing chromospheric fine structures with an Hα proxy using MURaM-ChE

 - **Abstract**
 H$\alpha$ observations of the solar chromosphere reveal dynamic small-scale structures known as spicules at the limb and rapid blue and red shifted excursions (RBEs/RREs) on-disk. We want to understand what drives these dynamic features, their magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) properties and their role in energy and heat transport to the upper solar atmosphere. To do this, we aim to develop a proxy for synthetic H$\alpha$ observations in radiative-MHD simulations to help identify these features. We use the chromospheric extension to the MURaM code (MURaM-ChE) to simulate an enhanced network region. We develop a proxy for H$\alpha$ based on a photon escape probability. This is a Doppler-shifted proxy that we use to identify fine structures in the line wings. We study on-disk features in 3D, obtaining their 3D structure from the absorption coefficient. We validate the H$\alpha$ proxy by comparing it against features detected in the wings of H$\alpha$ synthesized using MULTI3D. We detect numerous small-scale structures rooted at the network patches, similar to observations in H$\alpha$. The dynamics of an example feature (RBE) at a Doppler shift of 37 km/s show that flux emergence and consequent reconnection drive the formation of this feature. Pressure gradient forces build up to drive a flow along the field line carrying the feature, making it a jet. There is strong viscous and resistive heating at the first appearance of the feature associated with the flux emergence. At the same time and location, a heating front appears and propagates along the field lines at speeds comparable to the Alfven velocity. We show that a synthetic observable based on an escape probability is able to reliably identify features observed with the H$\alpha$ spectral line. We demonstrate its applicability by studying the formation, dynamics and properties of an RBE.
#### Bursting at the seams: the star-forming main sequence and its scatter at z=3-9 using NIRCam photometry from JADES

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) and its scatter at redshifts $3 \leq z \leq 9$, using NIRCam photometry from the JADES survey in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. Our analysis is based on a sample of galaxies that is stellar mass complete down to $\log \left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \approx 8.1$. The redshift evolution of the SFMS at an averaging timescale of 10 Myr follows a relation, quantified by the specific star-formation rates (sSFR$_{10}$), of $\mathrm{sSFR}\propto(1+z)^{\mu}$ with $\mu = 2.30^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$, in good agreement with theoretical predictions and the specific mass accretion rate of dark matter halos. We find that the SFMS normalisation varies in a complex way with the SFR averaging timescale, reflecting the combined effects of bursty star formation and rising star formation histories (SFHs). We quantify the scatter of the SFMS, revealing that it decreases with longer SFR averaging timescales, from $\sigma_{\rm{int}} \approx 0.4-0.5~\mathrm{dex}$ at 10 Myr to $\sigma_{\rm{int}} \approx 0.2~\mathrm{dex}$ at 100 Myr, indicating that shorter-term fluctuations dominate the scatter, although long-term variations in star formation activity are also present. Our findings suggest that bursty SFHs are more pronounced at lower stellar masses. Furthermore, we explore the implications of our results for the observed over-abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z > 10$, concluding that additional mechanisms, such as top-heavy initial mass functions, increased star-formation efficiencies, or increased burstiness in star formation are needed to explain these observations. Finally, we emphasize the importance of accurate stellar mass completeness limits when fitting the SFMS, especially for galaxies with bursty SFHs.
#### Investigating the residuals in the $M_\bullet-M_*$ relation using the SIMBA cosmological simulation

 - **Abstract**
 We study the scaling relation between the black hole and stellar mass ($M_\bullet-M_*$), diagnosing the residual $\Delta \log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)$ ($\Delta$) in this relation to understand the coevolution of the galaxy and black hole (BH) in the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation SIMBA. We showed that SIMBA can reproduce the observed $M_\bullet-M_*$ relation well with little difference between central and satellite galaxies. By using the median value to determine the residuals, we found that the residual is correlated with galaxy cold gas content, star formation rate, colour and black hole accretion properties. Both torque and Bondi models implemented in SIMBA, contribute to this residual, with torque accretion playing a major role at high redshift and low-mass galaxies, while Bondi (also BH merge) takes over at low redshift and massive galaxies. By dividing the sample into two populations: $\Delta>0$ and $\Delta <0$, we compared their evolution paths following the main progenitors. With evolution tracking, we proposed a simple picture for the BH-galaxy coevolution: Early-formed galaxies seeded black holes earlier, with stellar mass increasing rapidly to quickly reach the point of triggering `jet mode' feedback. This process reduced the cold gas content and stopped the growth of $M_*$, effectively quenching galaxies. Meanwhile, during the initial phase of torque accretion growth, the BH mass is comparable between galaxies formed early and those formed later. However, those galaxies that formed earlier appear to attain a marginally greater BH mass when shifting to Bondi accretion, aligning with the galaxy transition time. As the early-formed galaxies reach this point earlier -- leaving a longer time for them to have Bondi accretion as well as merging, their residuals become positive, i.e., having more massive BHs at $z=0$ compared to these late-formed galaxies at the same $M_*$. This picture is further supported by the strong positive correlation between the residuals and the galaxy age, which we are proposing as a verification with observation data on this story suggested by SIMBA.
#### A new constraint on the $y$-distortion with FIRAS: robustness of component separation methods

 - **Abstract**
 The sky-averaged Compton-$y$ distortion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) energy spectrum, $\langle y \rangle$, provides information about energy injection in the Universe occurring at $z \lesssim 5\times10^{4}$. It is primarily sourced by the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect -- the up-scattering of CMB photons on free electrons in collapsed dark matter halos. In this work and our companion paper, Ref. [1], we perform a re-analysis of the archival COBE/FIRAS data to constrain $\langle y \rangle$. We utilize two analysis approaches: (i) fitting the sky-averaged intensity spectrum (frequency monopole) and (ii) fitting the sky spectrum in each pixel (pixel-by-pixel). We obtain the baseline upper limits $\langle y \rangle < 31\times 10^{-6}$ and $\langle y \rangle < 8.3\times 10^{-6}$ (both at $95\%$ C.L.) for these two approaches, respectively. We present the first detailed comparison of these analysis methods on both mock skies and real data. Our findings suggest that accounting for the spatial variability of foregrounds via pixel-by-pixel fitting allows for tighter constraints on $\langle y \rangle$ by a factor of $\approx 3-5$ as compared to the frequency monopole method. We show that our frequency monopole results agree well with predictions from Fisher forecast techniques based on the sky-averaged signal, which have been used for forecasting future spectral distortion experiments. Our results thus suggest that the scientific reach of future spectral distortion experiments can potentially be enhanced by a factor of a few via more optimal component separation methods, and we identify the pixel-by-pixel method as one such robust way to achieve this. We discuss the implications of our improved constraints on $\langle y \rangle$ from the pixel-by-pixel method in Ref. [1].
