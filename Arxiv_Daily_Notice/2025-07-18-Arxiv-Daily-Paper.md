 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the magnetic field properties of 352 massive galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation with a focus on central magnetic field morphology in cool-core (CC) vs non-cool-core (NCC) clusters. We present the central values and radial profiles of magnetic field strength and plasma parameter as a function of mass, cooling status and redshift. Compared to low-redshift observations, TNG-Cluster produces reasonable magnetic field amplitudes in the central regions of clusters spanning a range of 1-200 muG. We then discuss the main finding of this work: z=0 cool-core clusters have preferentially tangential magnetic fields at a characteristic scale of ~ 0.1 r500c. These strongly tangential field orientations are specific to CCs. In contrast, across the full cluster population, magnetic fields show isotropic configurations at all radii and redshifts. As individual halos grow, the evolution of their magnetic field topologies is diverse: tangential features can be short-lived, persist over large cosmological time-scales, or periodically appear, vanish, and reappear towards z=0. We discuss the underlying physics and possible physical scenarios to explain the origin of these structures. We argue that both AGN feedback-driven outflows, and merger-driven sloshing motions, cannot explain the population-wide tangential bias in magnetic field orientation. Instead, we propose that the trapping of internal gravity waves is responsible for the tangentially biased magnetic field topologies that we find in cool-core TNG-Cluster halos, due to the strong entropy gradient in these clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of twenty tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at z<0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at z<0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong relation, and >45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs. Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution, unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.
#### Are the ONC, Pleiades, and Hyades snapshots of the same embedded cluster?

 - **Abstract**
 Using direct $N$-body simulations, we investigate the initial conditions and evolution of a star-forming region resembling the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) with the advanced \textsc{NBODY6} code. By varying the initial conditions, we aim to identify a model that closely aligns with observed parameters such as the half-mass radius, core radius, and total mass. Additionally, we examine the cluster's evolution over 800 Myr to determine whether it could reproduce the present-day properties of the Pleiades and Hyades along its evolutionary path. Under the influence of a Milky Way-like tidal field, the ONC experiences significant mass loss, primarily due to rapid gas expulsion, retaining approximately 47\% of its initial 4200 stars by about 100 Myr and only 9\% by about 700 Myr. These evolutionary stages closely match the properties of the Pleiades and Hyades, suggesting that an ONC-like cluster may have been their precursor. Additional models with varying degrees of primordial mass segregation indicate that the ONC likely had an initial half-mass radius of 0.2-0.3 pc, a total mass of 1200 - 2000 M$_\odot$, and a high degree of mass segregation. Models with an initial stellar count of about $N_{\text{in}} \approx 4 \times 10^3 - 5 \times 10^3$, rich in binaries and exhibiting mass segregation, show excellent agreement with observed cluster properties.
#### The vanishing of the long photometric cycle in AU Monocerotis

 - **Abstract**
 Double periodic variables (DPVs) are a group of semi-detached interacting binaries that exhibit a long photometric cycle with an average length of $\sim33$ times the orbital period of the system. It has been proposed that this long photometric cycle originates from a modulated mass transfer rate from the donor star, which itself is driven by an internal magnetic dynamo. One of the most well-studied DPVs in the Milky Way is AU Monocerotis (AU Mon). We aim to enhance our understanding of the long photometric cycle in AU Mon by characterising its behaviour through the analysis of available photometric data from several databases and surveys. We summarise previous findings on the system and analyse its published multi-wavelength photometry from different sources, covering 46.3 years, to study the variability of its light curve. We find that the orbital period has remained constant over recent decades, but the long cycle of approximately 417 days vanished around 2010. From an O-C analysis, we conclude that the system is experiencing a change in its orbital period of no greater than $0.038\pm0.040$ s yr$^{-1}$, and thus, imposing a value of $2\times10^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for $\dot{M}$ in a fully conservative mass transfer regime. A time-series analysis of the disentangling light curve in the Ic filter shows a transient periodicity of approximately 1910 days lasting at least 2000 days before it also disappears around the year 2020. An analysis of the available APASS light curves around the year 2013 shows a strong periodicity at approximately 280 days, which appears to be stronger in the Z filter. We report what is the second observation of the sudden disappearance of the long cycle in a DPV, after the Galactic DPV TYC 5353-1137-1. The disappearance of the long cycle in AU Mon is a strong constraint for current models that aim to explain the long cycle in DPVs.

 - **Abstract**
 The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its mass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational potential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \lesssim 4$ kpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear stellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies remain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling and those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics. To investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic gravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to observational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks, dark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate synthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity method to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed terminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature arises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity method to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \sim 0.4$ kpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner gas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass concentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not require a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming motions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear, Milky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of dynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate mass inference in the inner Milky Way.
#### A kinematic and structural study of young open clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy using Gaia DR3 catalogue

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study the dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence of dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of members in young clusters. We studied 14 young open clusters located within 1 kpc using the data from Gaia DR3 with the membership estimated using the GMM method. The cluster parameters such as age, distance, metallicity, and extinction were estimated by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the CMDs. These clusters are found to have ages between 6-90 Myr, located between 334-910 pc, covering a mass range, of 0.13 to 13.77 solar mass. In five of these clusters, stars from F to M spectral type show increasing velocity dispersion, a signature for dynamical relaxation. We detect high proper motion for B and A-type stars, possible walkaway stars in the other five clusters, Alessi Teutsch 5, ASCC 16, ASCC 21, IC 2395, and NGC 6405. We demonstrate the existence of mass-dependent velocity dispersion in young clusters suggestive of dynamical relaxation. The typical range of transverse velocity dispersion is found to be 0.40 - 0.70 km/s for young clusters.
#### A Torus Remnant Revealed by the Infrared Echo of TDE AT2019qiz: Implications for the Missing Energy and QPE Formation

 - **Abstract**
 AT2019qiz is the first standard optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with detection of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), providing strong evidence for TDE-QPE association. Moreover, it belongs to the rare subset of optical TDEs with prominent infrared (IR) echoes revealed by the multi-epoch photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The IR light curve shows an early bump, followed by a steady rise until the second-to-last epoch, after which it appears to enter a plateau phase. The dust temperature decreased until the fourth epoch and remains approximately constant for the subsequent five epochs. We have fitted the last five epochs using a convex dust ring model, resulting in an inner radius $>1.2$ pc. Such a large radius greatly exceeds the inner radius of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus for a $10^6\,M_{\odot}$ black hole and thus could be a torus remnant with the inner part having vanished, further supporting the unified scenario of recently faded AGNs, TDEs, and QPEs. Consequently, a connection between QPEs and IR-bright TDEs is naturally expected. Moreover, the echo requires at least a peak bolometric luminosity of $(6.6, 9.5, 1.0)\times 44 \,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ assuming silicate, silicon carbide, and graphite dust grains, respectively, all of which are significantly higher than the peak optical blackbody luminosity. It adds to the accumulating evidence that the missing energy of TDEs may lie in the unobservable extreme UV. This work highlights the unique value of IR echoes in the study of TDEs and QPEs, and a promising prospect in the era of the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, the successor to WISE.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming Stage-IV surveys will deliver measurements of distribution of matter with unprecedented precision, demanding highly accurate theoretical models for cosmological parameter inference. A major source of modeling uncertainty lies in astrophysical processes associated with galaxy formation and evolution, which remain poorly understood. Probes such as the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, X-rays, and dispersion measure from fast radio bursts offer a promising avenue for mapping the distribution and thermal properties of cosmic baryons. A unified analytical framework capable of jointly modeling these observables is essential for fully harnessing the complementary information while mitigating probe-specific systematics. In this work, we present a detailed assessment of existing analytical models, which differ in their assumptions and prescriptions for simultaneously describing the distribution of matter and baryons in the universe. Using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation, we test these models by jointly analyzing the 3D auto- and cross-power spectra of the matter and baryonic fields that underpin the above probes. We find that all models can reproduce the power spectra at sub-percent to few-percent accuracy, depending on the tracer combination and number of free parameters. Their ability to recover underlying halo properties, such as the evolution of gas abundance and thermodynamic profiles with halo mass, varies considerably. Our results suggest that these models require further refinement and testing for reliable interpretation of multi-wavelength datasets.
#### Where is the Supervirial Gas? III. Insights from X-ray Shadow Observations and a revised Model for the Soft Diffuse X-ray Background

 - **Abstract**
 Shadow observations provide a powerful tool to separate foreground components of the soft diffuse X-ray background (SDXB) from the background components. Such observations have now established that the ``local'' foreground is made of the solar wind charge exchange and the local bubble, and the background emission is from the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way and from the unresolved extragalactic sources. New data and careful analyses of the SDXB led to two new discoveries in recent years: (1) excess emission near 0.5 keV that is identified as the NVII emission line, and (2) excess emission near 0.8-1.0 keV that is identified with an additional, super-virial temperature hot thermal component of the CGM. The goal of this paper is to use Suzaku shadow observations along six sightlines to determine whether either of these components is from the ``local'' sources. We eliminate the ambiguity regarding the origin of NVII emission, ruling out the local origin. We confirm that the Milky Way CGM contains nitrogen-rich plasma, with a super-solar average (N/O) of 2.6+-0.5, and suggest that nitrogen-enhanced plasma is widespread throughout the CGM. We find super-solar Ne abundance in two sighlines, also from the CGM. Similarly, we rule out the local origin of the hot thermal component and confirm that it is present beyond the shadowing clouds. Furthermore, we provide a revised model of the soft diffuse X-ray background, which is crucial for extragalactic astronomy.
