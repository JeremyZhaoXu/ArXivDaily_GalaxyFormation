 - **Abstract**
 Unveiling the 3D shape of the Milky Way's dark-matter halo is critical to understanding its formation history. We created an innovative dynamical model with minimal assumptions on the internal dynamical structures and accommodates a highly flexible triaxial DM halo. By applying the method to 6D phase-space data of K-giant stars from LAMOST + Gaia, we robustly determine the 3D dark-matter distribution of the Milky Way out to approximately 50 kpc. We discover a triaxial, nearly oblate dark-matter halo with $q_{\rm DM} = Z/X= 0.92\pm0.08$, $p_{\rm DM} = Y/X= 0.8\pm0.2$ averagely within 50 kpc, where $Z$ axis is defined perpendicular to the stellar disk. The axes ratio $q_{\rm DM} > p_{\rm DM}$ is strongly preferred; the long-intermediate axis plane of the dark-matter halo is unexpectedly vertical to the Galactic disk, yet aligned with the `plane of satellites'. This striking configuration suggests that the Galactic disk has flipped, likely torqued by minor mergers, from an original alignment with the dark-matter halo and satellite plane, as supported by Milky Way analogues from Auriga and TNG 50. By allowing $q_{\rm DM}(r)$ and $p_{\rm DM}(r)$ vary with radii, we find tentative evidence that the dark-matter halo is twisted, being more oblate in the inner regions, and only become vertically aligned at $r\gtrsim 20$ kpc, also consistent with the prediction of the disk flip scenario. Such disk reorientation is non-trivial yet its physical mechanism is straightforward to comprehend and naturally originates a vertical satellite plane. Our findings offer a unified framework that links dark-matter halo orientation, satellite alignment, and disk evolution, reinforcing the internal consistency of the Milky Way in $\Lambda$CDM model.
#### 3D Moving-mesh Hydrodynamical Simulations of Wind/Jet Driven Ultraluminous X-ray Source Bubbles

 - **Abstract**
 We perform 3 dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamical simulations of bubble nebulae around ultraluminous X-ray sources, using state-of-the-art software AREPO. We use a Monte-Carlo method to inject outflows with uniform mass outflow rate and momentum, in a conical funnel with a specific half opening angle. Simulation results show that the morphology of the bubble is determined by the initial momentum of the outflows, while the mechanical power of the outflows only influences the size of the bubble without changing its shape. Low mechanical power also results in a short cooling timescale of the system, leading to an early collapse of the bubble shell. The half opening angle of the outflows and the viewing angle of the system determine the observed bubble eccentricity together. Compared with the observational morphology of the ULX bubble sources NGC 55 ULX-1 and NGC 1313 X-2, our simulation favors the fact that the high velocity outflows of the accretion disks in these two systems are confined in a narrow funnel region.
#### Safely simplifying redshift drift computations in inhomogeneous cosmologies: Insights from LTB Swiss-cheese models

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most important discoveries in cosmology is the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Yet, the accelerated expansion has only ever been measured {\em in}directly. Redshift drift offers a direct observational probe of the Universe's expansion history, with its sign revealing whether there has been acceleration or deceleration between source and observer. Its detection will mark a major milestone in cosmology, offering the first direct measurement of an evolving expansion rate. Given its epistemic importance, it is essential to understand how its measurements can be biased. One possibility of bias comes from cosmological structures. However, theoretical estimates of such effects are difficult to obtain because computing redshift drift in general inhomogeneous cosmologies is computationally demanding, requiring the solution of 24 coupled ordinary differential equations. In this work, we use Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese models to show that only the two dominant contributions are needed to achieve percent-level accuracy up to $z = 1$. This allows the reduction of the full system of 24 ODEs to the standard null geodesic equations, significantly simplifying the calculation. \newline\indent Although our analysis is based on idealized Swiss-cheese models with spherical structures, we expect that similar simplifications apply to more complex scenarios, including cosmological N-body simulations. Our analysis thus underpins a practical and robust framework for efficient redshift drift computations applicable to a wider range of inhomogeneous cosmologies.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Current large-scale, high-cadence surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), provide detections of new and rare types of transients and supernovae whose physical origins are not well understood. Aims. We investigate the nature of SN 2021lwz at a redshift z=0.065, an overluminous supernova (SN) of absolute magnitude, $M_{g} \sim -20.1$ AB, falling in the lower range of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) luminosities, and discovered in a faint dwarf galaxy with an absolute magnitude of $M_{g} \simeq -14.5$ AB. Methods. SN 2021lwz is studied using optical spectroscopy, photometry and imaging linear polarimetry obtained during several follow-up campaigns. All the data are used to analyse and model the evolution of the explosion. Comparisons with other SNe of well known or rarer types are investigated. Results. SN 2021lwz belongs to the rare class of rapidly evolving transients. The bolometric light curve rises in about 7 days to a peak luminosity of about 5 x10^{43} erg/s, at a rate of 0.2 mag/day close to the peak. Spectroscopy modeling reveals more similarities with a normal Type Ic-like SN than with a SLSN before peak, showing broadened lines after peak. Light curve modeling shows that the Arnett model of the bolometric light curve using a radioactive source ($^{56}$ Ni) is not able to reasonably explain the light curve evolution. A magnetar model seems more appropriate, suggesting that the explosion of low ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.24 ~M_\odot$) took place in a low mass ($M \sim 10^{6.66}~M_\odot$) dwarf galaxy of specific star-formation rate about ten times larger than typical star-forming galaxies. Conclusions. Given its spectroscopic properties and the low ejecta mass needed to model its light-curve, SN 2021lwz does not match with many core-collapse H-poor SNe Types. It shares similarities with rarer transients like SN 2014ft, iPTF 16asu and SN 2018gep.
#### Catalog of Mock Stellar Streams in Milky Way-Like Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamically cold stellar streams from tidally dissolved globular clusters (GCs) serve as excellent tools to measure the Galactic mass distribution and show promise to probe the nature of dark matter. For successful application of these tools to observations, it is essential to have an accurate model of stellar stream properties on the Galactic scale. To this end we produce a mock catalog of stellar streams in four simulated Milky Way-like galaxies. We build the catalog with three main components: a model for the formation and disruption of globular clusters based on cosmological simulations, time-dependent potentials constructed with basis function expansions for integrating stream orbits, and an improved particle spray algorithm for efficient generation of stellar streams. We find that the observable widths and lengths of mock streams as a function of galactocentric radius are well described by power-laws for streams beyond 10 kpc. We generate mock photometry for Gaia, LSST, and Roman, and find that the latter two surveys will increase the number of observable stars in GC stellar streams by several orders of magnitude. Our full catalog, containing stream populations across four different galaxy realizations, is publicly available and can be used to study stream population statistics and to calibrate models which use stellar streams to understand our Galaxy.
