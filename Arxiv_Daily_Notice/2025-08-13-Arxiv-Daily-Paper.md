 - **Abstract**
 The metal-poor stars of a galaxy offer insights into that galaxy's early formation processes and accretion history. Here, we investigate whether the metal-poor stars of our Milky Way galaxy exhibit any characteristic trends in Galactocentric distance versus chemical abundances -- i.e. in the space of $r_{\rm GC}$ vs. [Fe/H] and $r_{\rm GC}$ vs. [X/Fe] -- and if yes, then what is their implication for Galaxy formation. We combine the datasets of APOGEE DR17 and $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3, where the former provides stellar abundances and the latter provides stellar parallaxes. We analyze bright ($G<13$) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$<-1.2$) stars located far from the disk ($|z|\geq1$ kpc), and explore a total of $19$ abundances. We find that $9$ different abundances exhibit a drastic transition in their distribution near the Solar radius $r_{\rm GC}=8$ kpc. This trend is very unlikely to be related to radial migration, as our metal-poor sample does not contain any disk star. We also analyze the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus stars, which is a dominant metal-poor population of the Galaxy, and find that it alone cannot account for this trend. This suggests that the Milky Way's metal-poor populations inside and outside the Solar radius likely originated from distinct chemical enrichment scenarios and formation processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events are rare and diverse transients that occur when a star is torn apart by a supermassive black hole and accreted, which can result in a supersoft X-ray thermal transient. Here, we present nine tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates identified in eROSITA-DE Data Release 1 through a novel search for such supersoft sources. We select candidates by comparing the catalogued count rates in several combinations of bands and evaluate the nature of selected sources to produce our sample, among which five are entirely new X-ray TDE candidates. All our candidates' X-ray spectra are consistent with soft thermal emission and we show them to have faded through additional Swift observations and catalogued data. We investigate publicly available data from ground- and space-based telescopes and find two of our sources have optical counterparts and four sources show flaring in their NEOWISE IR light curves. The high proportion of our sources with IR flares compared to optically selected TDE samples could suggest a link between supersoft X-ray spectra and IR counterparts. We fit the IR light curves with a model of a spherical dust shell heated by the TDE and find these results to be broadly consistent with those of other TDEs with IR counterparts. Finally, we examine the host galaxies and show them to be similar to the general TDE host population.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of intergalactic absorbers in the Local Group suggest the existence of a velocity dipole in the general barycentre--antibarycentre direction which can be interpreted as evidence of a general flow of material towards the group's centre of mass. In this work, we study the kinematics of gas in the Local Group using one of the high-resolution realisations of the {\sc Hestia} simulations with a particular focus on the evidence left by different ionic species. Our simulation includes the correct cosmography for a region similar to the Local Group and a relative radial velocity between the candidate Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies consistent with the observed one. We examine the distribution and kinematics of six ionic species (H\,{\sc i}, C\,{\sc iv}, Si\,{\sc iii}, O\,{\sc vi}, O\,{\sc vii} and O\,{\sc viii}) and their imprints on synthetic sky maps constructed from the reference frames commonly used by observers. Our results indicate the presence of such a dipole for gas outside the Milky Way halo, favouring a paradigm in which the Milky Way is moving against the gas in the direction of the barycentre, while moving away from it in the opposite direction. This pattern is clearer for the higher oxygen ions, which preferentially trace hot gas. On the other hand, we observe a slight asymmetry in the pressure profiles in both directions, indicating higher pressures in the inner regions of the Local Group.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the number density of massive ($ \mathrm{ log (M_{*}/M_{\odot}) > 10.3} $) quiescent galaxies at $2<z<5$ using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra. This work relies on spectra from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer physical properties and number densities. We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ($\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ by $4<z<5$), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy formation simulations. At $z>3$, most simulations fail to produce enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 We selected BHB stars based on synthetic photometry and stellar atmosphere parameters inferred from Gaia Bp/Rp spectra. We generated the synthetic SDSS broad-band $ugr$ and Pristine narrow-band CaHK magnitudes from Gaia Bp/Rp data. A photometric selection of BHB candidates was made in the $(u-g, g-r)$ and $(u-\mathrm{CaHK},g-r)$ color-color spaces. A spectroscopic selection in $T_\mathrm{eff}-\log g$ space was applied to remove stars with high surface gravity. The selection function of BHB stars was obtained by using the Gaia DR3 photometry. A non-parametric method that allows the variation in the vertical flattening $q$ with the Galactic radius, was adopted to explore the density shape of the stellar halo. We present a catalog of 44,552 high latitude ($|b|>20^\circ$) BHB candidates chosen with a well-characterized selection function. The stellar halo traced by these BHB stars is more flattened at smaller radii ($q=0.4$ at $r\sim8$ kpc), and becomes nearly spherical at larger radii ($q=0.8$ at $r\sim25$ kpc). Assuming a variable flattening and excluding several obvious outliers that might be related to the halo substructures or contaminants, we obtain a smooth and consistent relationship between $r$ and $q$, and the density profile is best fit with by a single power law with an index $\alpha=-4.65\pm0.04$.
#### Halo Occupation Distribution of Quasars: Dependence on Luminosity, Redshift, Black Hole Mass and Feedback Modes

 - **Abstract**
 We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\sim 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function. We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias ({\bf a factor of $\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\sim 10-70\%$ in the satellite occupation fraction}) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \%$ of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous clustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space is well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the high-alpha component of the Galactic bulge remains debated, unlike the bar-driven origin of the low-alpha bulge. We examine the metallicity-dependent dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bar region, using samples of low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars from APOGEE DR17, complemented by the PIGS catalogue of [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ stars. The mean Galactocentric rotational velocity $ \overline V_\phi(R) $ is nearly cylindrical for both low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars across the bulge and outer bar. $\overline V_\phi(R)$ of high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $ is similar within errors to low-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bulge, and $ 10-20\% $ lower in the outer bar. The mean radial velocity field of these stars exhibits a quadrupole pattern similar to low-[Mg/Fe] stars. Orbit integrations in realistic barred Galactic potentials show that these model-independent properties correspond to a peanut bulge in the orbital density distributions for high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $, transitioning toward a more spheroidal structure at lower metallicities. Additionally, $ \overline V_\phi$ ([Fe/H]) increases steeply as metallicity rises from about [Fe/H] $ \sim -1.3 $, resembling the spin-up observed at larger Galactic radii. This is accompanied by a transition in the dominant orbit families, from co- and counter-rotating cloud A and $ \rm x_4 $ orbits at low metallicities to co-rotating bar-supporting $ \rm x_1 $ family tree, box, and cloud A orbits at solar metallicity. Our results strengthen the case that the bulk of the high-[Mg/Fe] component in the bar region evolved from an alpha-enhanced disc, while metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ trace a more turbulent origin.
