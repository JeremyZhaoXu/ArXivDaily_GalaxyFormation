#### Dynamical Friction Constraints on the Dark Matter Hypothesis Across Astronomical Scales
 - **Authors:** X. Hernandez (UNAM), Pavel Kroupa (Bonn. Prague)

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical friction implies a consistency check on any system where dark matter particles are hypothesised to explain orbital dynamics requiring more mass under Newtonian gravity than is directly detectable. Introducing the assumption of a dominant dark matter halo will also imply a decay timescale for the orbits in question. A self-consistency constraint hence arises, such that the resulting orbital decay timescales must be longer than the lifetimes of the systems in question. While such constraints are often trivially passed, the combined dependencies of dynamical friction timescales on the mass and orbital radius of the orbital tracer and on the density and velocity dispersion of the assumed dark matter particles leads to the existence of a number of astronomical systems where such a consistency test is failed. Here, we review cases from stars in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, galactic bars, satellite galaxies, and, particularly, the multi-period mutual orbits of the Magellanic Clouds, as recently inferred from the star formation histories of these two galaxies, as well as the nearby M81 group of galaxies, where introducing enough dark matter to explain observed kinematics leads to dynamical friction orbital decay timescales shorter than the lifetimes of the systems in question. Taken together, these observations exclude dark matter halos made of particles as plausible explanations for the observed kinematics of these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 It is widely believed that the ultraviolet background produced during the epoch of reionization conspires against the formation of low-mass galaxies. Indeed, this mechanism is often invoked as a solution to the so-called `missing satellites problem.' In this paper we employ FIREbox, a large-volume cosmological simulation based on the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model, to characterize the mechanisms governing galaxy ignition in the post-reionization era. By carefully matching recently-ignited halos (with stellar ages below $100$ Myr) to halos that failed to form any stars, we conclude that the presence of cold-dense gas and halo concentration help incite the process of galaxy formation. Concretely, we find that $100\%$ of recently-ignited halos experience cold-dense gas enhancements relative to their matched failed counterparts. Likewise, approximately $83\%$ display enhancements in both cold-dense gas and Navarro-Frenk-White concentration ($c_{\rm NFW}$), while the remaining $\sim17\%$ exhibit enhanced cold-dense gas content and suppressed $c_{\rm NFW}$ values. Lastly, our simulation suggests that galaxy ignition can occur as late as $z=2$, potentially allowing us to observationally catch this process `in the act' in the forseeable future.
#### Revealing Hidden Cosmic Flows through the Zone of Avoidance with Deep Learning
 - **Authors:** Alexandra Dupuy, Donghui Jeong, Sungwook E. Hong, Ho Seong Hwang, Juhan Kim, Hélène M. Courtois
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03919

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03919

 - **Abstract**
 We present a refined deep-learning-based method to reconstruct the three-dimensional dark matter density, gravitational potential, and peculiar velocity fields in the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), a region near the galactic plane with limited observational data. Using a convolutional neural network (V-Net) trained on A-SIM simulation data, our approach reconstructs density or potential fields from galaxy positions and radial peculiar velocities. The full 3D peculiar velocity field is then derived from the reconstructed potential. We validate the method with mocks that mimic the spatial distribution of the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalog and apply it to actual data. Given CF4's significant observational uncertainties and since our model does not yet account for them, we use peculiar velocities corrected via an existing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo reconstruction, rather than raw catalog distances. Our results demonstrate that the reconstructed density field recovers known galaxy clusters detected in an H \textsc{i} survey of the ZOA, despite this dataset not being used in the reconstruction. This agreement underscores the potential of our method to reveal structures in data-sparse regions. Most notably, streamline convergence and watershed analysis identify a mass concentration consistent with the Great Attractor, at $(l, b) = (308.4^\circ \pm 2.4^\circ, 29.0^\circ \pm 1.9^\circ)$ and $cz = 4960.1 \pm 404.4,{\rm km/s}$, for 64\% of realizations. Our method is particularly valuable as it does not rely on data point density, enabling accurate reconstruction in data-sparse regions and offering strong potential for future surveys with more extensive galaxy datasets.
#### Cosmic voids and the kinetic analysis. V. Hubble tension, the cosmological constant and aperiodic filaments
 - **Authors:** V.G. Gurzadyan, N.N. Fimin, V.M. Chechetkin
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03990

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03990

 - **Abstract**
 The appearance and specific properties of the structures in the local Universe are studied by means of the Vlasov kinetic technique. The role of the cosmological constant in the local structure formation is considered via the theorem on the general function satisfying the identity of the gravity of sphere and of point mass. Then, the Hubble tension is naturally explained as a result of two flows, local and global one, with non-coinciding Hubble parameters. The linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with the cosmological term is shown to lead to van Kampen's waves, of Landau damping and then to aperiodic structures. The aperiodicity thus is emerging as a intrinsic feature of the filamentary and void structure of the local Universe, revealing the self-consistent field mechanism of its formation. The damping of the aperiodicity then is predicted and can be observationally traced upon the increase of the scale of the filaments.
#### Ultra-Diffuse, Ultra-Different: Observed vs. Simulated Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies Live in Fundamentally Different Halos

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we compare galaxies from the NIHAO and HESTIA simulation suites to ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with spectroscopically measured dynamical masses. For each observed UDG, we identify the simulated dark matter halo that best matches its dynamical mass. In general, observed UDGs are matched to simulated galaxies with lower stellar masses than they are observed to have. These simulated galaxies also have halo masses much less than would be expected given the observed UDG's stellar mass and the stellar mass -- halo mass relationship. We use the recently established relation between globular cluster (GC) number and halo mass, which has been shown to be applicable to UDGs, to better constrain their observed halo masses. This method indicates that observed UDGs reside in relatively massive dark matter halos. This creates a striking discrepancy: the simulated UDGs are matched to the dynamical masses of observed ones, but not their total halo masses. In other words, simulations can produce UDGs in halos with the correct inner dynamics, but not with the massive halos implied by GC counts. We explore several possible explanations for this tension, from both the observational and theoretical sides. We propose that the most likely resolution is that observed UDGs may have fundamentally different dark matter halo profiles than those produced in NIHAO and HESTIA. This highlights the need for a simulation that self-consistently produces galaxies of a stellar mass of $\sim 10^8 M_\odot$ in dark matter halos that exhibit the full range of large dark matter cores to cuspy NFW-like halos.
#### Exploring Cosmological Constraints of the Void-Lensing Cross-Correlation in the CSST Photometric Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological constraints from the void-lensing cross-correlation assuming the $w$CDM model for the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) photometric survey. Using Jiutian simulations, we construct a mock galaxy catalog to $z=3$ covering 100 deg$^2$, which incorporates the instrumental and observational effects of the CSST. We divide the galaxy sample into seven photometric-redshift (photo-$z$) tomographic bins and identify 2D voids within each bin using the Voronoi tessellation and watershed algorithm. We measure the angular cross-power spectrum between the void distribution and the weak lensing signal, and estimate the covariance matrix via jackknife resampling combined with pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ approach to account for the partial sky correction. We employ the Halo Void Dust Model (HVDM) to model the void-matter cross-power spectrum and adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that our method can accurately extract the cosmological information, and the constraint accuracies of some cosmological parameters from the void-lensing analysis are comparable or even tighter than the weak lensing only case. This demonstrates that the void-lensing serves as an effective cosmological probe and a valuable complement to galaxy photometric surveys, particularly for the Stage-IV surveys targeting the high-redshift Universe.
#### NANOGrav 15-year gravitational-wave signals from binary supermassive black-holes seeded by primordial black holes

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explain the recently reported a nHz-band gravitational-wave background from NANOGrav 15-year through the merger of binary super-massive black holes with masses of $10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed by the growth of primordial black holes. When a primordial black hole accretes at a high accretion rate, it emits a large number of high-energy photons. These heat the plasma, causing high-redshift cosmological 21cm line emission. Since this has not been detected, there is a strict upper bound on the accretion rate. We have found that with the primordial black hole abundance $10^{-14} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-12}$ and the mass $1 M_{\odot} \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^3 M_{\odot}$, we successfully fit the nHz band gravitational wave background from NANOGrav 15-year while avoiding the 21 cm line emission. We propose that future observations of the gravitational wave background and the cosmological 21cm line can test this scenario.
#### Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: IX: Spectroscopic detection of rare earth Dysprosium, Erbium, Lutetium and Thorium in Classical Cepheids

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids are among the most important distance calibrators and play a crucial role in the calibration as the first rung of the extragalactic distance ladder. Given their typical age, they also constitute an optimal tracer of the young population in the Galactic disc. We aim to increase the number of available DCEPS with high-resolution spectroscopic metallicities, to study the galactocentric radial gradients of several chemical elements and analyse the spatial distribution of the Galactic young population of stars in the Milky Way disc. We performed a complete spectroscopical analysis of 136 spectra obtained from three different high-resolution spectrographs, for a total of 60 DCEPs. More than half have pulsational periods longer than 15 days, up to 70 days, doubling the number of stars in our sample with P>15d. We derived radial velocities, atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances up to 33 different species. We present an updated list of trusted spectroscopic lines for the detection and estimation of chemical abundances. We used this new set to revisit the abundances already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey and increase the number of available chemical species. For the first time (to our knowledge), we present the estimation of abundances for Dysprosium, as well as a systematic estimation of Erbium, Lutetium and Thorium abundances. We calculate a galactic radial gradient for [Fe/H] with a slope of $-0.064\pm0.002$, in good agreement with recent literature estimation. The other elements also exhibit a clear negative radial trend, with this effect diminishing and eventually disappearing for heavier neutron-capture elements. Depending on the proposed spiral arms model present in several literature sources, our most external stars agree on tracing either the Perseus, the Norma-Outer or both the Outer and the association Outer-Scutum-Centaurus (OSC) arms.
#### The Apache Point Observatory extra-Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOeGEE): Chemical Abundance Trends for Seven Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies in the APOGEE Survey

 - **Abstract**
 In addition to comprehensive surveys of the Milky Way bulge, disk, and halo, the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) project observed seven dwarf spheroidal satellites (dSphs) of the Milky Way: Carina, Sextans, Sculptor, Draco, Ursa Minor, Bootes 1, and Fornax. APOGEE radial velocities, stellar parameters, and Gaia EDR3 proper motions are used to identify member stars in the vicinity of each dwarf. To properly analyze the abundance patterns of these galaxies, a novel procedure was developed to determine the measurable upper limits of the APOGEE chemical abundances as a function of the effective temperature and the spectral signal-to-noise ratio. In general, the APOGEE abundance patterns of these galaxies (limited to [Fe/H] $>$ -2.5) agree with those found in high-resolution optical studies after abundance offsets are applied. Most of the galaxies studied have abundance patterns that are distinctly different from the majority of stars found in the MW halo, suggesting that these galaxies contributed little to the MW halo above [Fe/H] $>$ -2.0. From these abundance patterns, we find that these dSphs tend to follow two types of chemical evolution paths: episodic and continuous star formation, a result that is consistent with previous photometric studies of their star formation histories. We explore whether mass and/or environment have an impact on whether a galaxy has an episodic or continuous star formation history, finding evidence that, in addition to the galaxy's mass, proximity to a larger galaxy and the cessation of star formation may drive the overall shape of the chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from JWST have revealed unexpectedly luminous galaxies, exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \geq 10$) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (${\rm M}_{\rm halo}\geq5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at $10\leq z\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.

 - **Abstract**
 Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level. Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs. Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m - S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.
