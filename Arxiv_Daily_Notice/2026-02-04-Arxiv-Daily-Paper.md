 - **Abstract**
 We compile a sample of 83 Little Red Dots (LRDs) with JWST imaging and find that a substantial fraction ($\sim$43%, rising to $\gtrsim$85% for the most luminous LRDs) host one or more spatially offset, UV-bright companions at projected separations of $0.5\rm \, kpc \lesssim d\lesssim 5 \rm \,kpc$, with median of $\langle d \rangle = 1.0\,\mathrm{kpc}$. This fraction is even higher when smaller spatial scales are probed at high S/N ratio: we show that the two most strongly lensed LRDs known to date, A383-LRD and the newly discovered A68-LRD, both have UV-bright companions at separations of only $d\sim0.3$ kpc, below the resolution limit of most unlensed JWST samples. We explore whether these ubiquitous red/blue configurations may be physically linked to the formation of LRDs, in analogy with the "synchronized pair" scenario originally proposed for direct-collapse black hole formation. In this picture, ultraviolet radiation from the companions, which typically have modest stellar masses ($M_\ast \sim 10^{8-9}M_\odot$), suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, allowing nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects, such as massive black holes or quasi-stars. Using component-resolved photometry and SED modeling, we infer Lyman-Werner radiation fields of $J_{21,LW} \sim 10^{2.5}$-$10^{5}$ at the locations of the red components, comparable to those required in direct-collapse models, suggesting that the necessary photodissociation conditions are realized in many LRD systems. This framework provides a simple and self-consistent explanation for the extreme compactness and distinctive spectral properties of LRDs, and links long-standing theoretical models for early compact object formation directly to a population now observed with JWST in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a revised spectroscopic redshift for the dusty massive galaxy S1, previously inferred with an exceptionally high baryon-to-star conversion efficiency from NIRCam slitless grism data at $z_{\rm grism}=5.58$. Our new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations reveal multiple rest-frame optical and NIR emission lines, yielding a secure spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=3.2439\pm0.0002$. We show that the earlier grism-based redshift resulted from contamination by a nearby galaxy whose dispersed spectral trace overlaps with S1, illustrating a known challenge of slitless spectroscopy when only a single dispersion angle and single emission feature are available. In addition, we present new ALMA 1 mm observations, which robustly detect dust emission ($S_{\rm 1mm}=0.99\pm0.03$ mJy) and show a dust half-light radius ($R_{\rm e,1mm}=0.73\pm0.10$ kpc) slightly smaller than the stellar size ($R_{\rm e, F444W} = 0.97\pm0.01$ kpc). Using the revised redshift and compiled multi-wavelength photometry, we update the UV-to-FIR SED and find that S1 is less extreme than previously inferred, yet remains a very massive (log$M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\sim10.6$), heavily obscured star-forming galaxy. The updated SED modeling reveals S1 to be a very dust- and gas-rich system with a moderate star formation rate and a long gas depletion time ($\tau_{\rm dep} \sim 1.4$ Gyr), deviating from SMGs and OFGs, but more closely resembling typical massive main-sequence galaxies. We note that, although this revision reduces the number of ultra-massive galaxies reported in Xiao et al. 2024, it does not alter the main conclusions of that work. Overall, our study clarifies the nature of S1 and underscores the importance of multi-line spectroscopic confirmation, slitless observations at multiple position angles, and IFU data for robust redshift and physical characterization of rare massive galaxies in the early Universe.
#### JWST Discovery of High-Velocity Mid-Infrared Ionized Outflows in Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies F11119+3257 and F05189-2524

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) are thought to be a driving mechanism of large-scale winds driven by active galactic nuclei, which cause significant galactic feedback through quenching star formation and regulating supermassive black hole growth. We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer observations of two nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), F11119+3257 and F05189-2524, with nuclear X-ray detected UFOs and kiloparsec-scale outflow. These galaxies show remarkably similar mid-infrared continuum and emission line features, notably including a high-velocity $v_{90}$ $\sim$ 4000 km s$^{-1}$ outflow detected in highly ionized neon emission lines, e.g., \nevi. In F05189-2524, we see a slightly slower biconical outflow extending up to $\sim2$ kpc in the same neon emission lines. Both sources show evidence of AGN-driven radiative feedback through a deficit of rotational molecular hydrogen lines in the nuclear region, $<$1 kpc from the central quasar, but no clear evidence of any molecular gas entrained in the quasar-driven outflow. Energetic analysis shows that the warm ionized gas in both of these sources contributes minimally ($\sim0.1-5\%$) to the momentum outflow rate of these sources and leaves the conclusions of previous literature unchanged: the energetics of these sources are broadly consistent with a momentum-conserving outflow.
