#### Collapse of Magnetized White Dwarfs as site of Heavy Element Formation and Kilonova Signal
 - **Authors:** Tetyana Pitik, David Radice, Daniel Kasen, Fabio Magistrelli, Patrick Chi-Kit Cheong, Sebastiano Bernuzzi

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first end-to-end calculation connecting the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a magnetized, rapidly rotating white dwarf to observable kilonova signatures, combining 2D general-relativistic neutrino-magnetohydrodynamic simulations, followed by radiation hydrodynamics with in-situ nuclear network and 2D Monte Carlo radiative transfer with spatially resolved heating rates. Unlike all previous unmagnetized AIC models - which predicted proton-rich, $^{56}$Ni-dominated ejecta - strong magnetic fields eject ${\sim 0.2 M_\odot}$ of neutron-rich material $(\langle Y_e \rangle \sim 0.24)$ on dynamical timescales, before neutrino irradiation can raise the electron fraction, enabling strong $r$-process nucleosynthesis up to and beyond the third peak. The resulting kilonova is lanthanide-rich $(X_{\rm lan} \approx 6\%)$ and dominated by near-infrared emission. We compute synthetic light curves in the LSST and JWST bands and find striking agreement, without parameter tuning, between the observations of AT 2023vfi/GRB 230307A and our broadband light curves for polar viewing angles. These results establish magnetized AIC as a viable channel for heavy $r$-process element production and a compelling progenitor candidate for long-duration gamma-ray bursts with kilonova signatures.
#### FRESCO: Constraining Dust Attenuation and Star-Formation Rates of $z\sim 2$ Star-Forming Galaxies with JWST Paschen and Ground-Based Balmer Emission Line Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present new constraints on dust attenuation and star-formation rates (SFRs) for 77 galaxies at redshifts $z=1.43-2.65$, using Paschen emission line detections from the JWST FRESCO survey and ground-based Balmer line measurements from the MOSDEF survey. Using nebular and continuum emission maps, we find that Paschen emission covers a smaller area than continuum emission observed in the F210M (2.1 $\mu$m; rest-frame optical) and F444W (4.4 $\mu$m; rest-frame near-IR) bands, and is preferentially located toward galaxy outskirts. These results suggest that current star formation is concentrated in regions farther from galaxy centers than older stellar populations traced by the continuum, indicative of inside-out star formation. With a careful accounting of slit-loss corrections for ground-based measurements, we calculate nebular reddening and dust-corrected SFRs using the Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$) and Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios (Pa$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$/H$\alpha$), assuming the Milky Way extinction curve. On average, Paschen-derived reddening and SFRs agree with Balmer-derived values; however, two galaxies exhibit significantly higher Paschen reddening and four show significantly higher Paschen SFRs. We find that non-unity dust covering fractions bias the Balmer decrement toward less reddened OB associations, while decrements involving the Paschen lines are less affected by this bias. These results highlight the enhanced sensitivity of the Paschen lines to the most heavily obscured OB associations in $z\sim2$ galaxies, particularly in galaxies with patchy dust geometries. Future studies using Paschen lines exclusively to measure nebular reddening will yield more robust constraints on the dustiest star-forming regions.
#### Formation timescales for stellar bars in diverse galactic discs
 - **Authors:** Matthew Frosst, Danail Obreschkow, Aaron Ludlow
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21748

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.21748

 - **Abstract**
 We study the formation of stellar bars using 145 simulations of disc galaxies embedded in live and static dark matter haloes. We use the exponential bar growth timescale, $\tau_{\rm bar}$, to quantify how disc structure and kinematics regulate the onset and rate of secular bar formation. We extend previous work to thicker and more turbulent discs, motivated by those observed at high redshift ($z>1$). By revisiting several commonly used disc stability criteria - the Efstathiou-Lake-Negroponte parameter ($\epsilon_{\rm ELN}$), the Ostriker-Peebles ratio ($t_{\rm OP}$), and the disc stellar mass fraction within 2.2 disc scale radii ($f_{\rm disc}$) - we find that $\tau_{\rm bar}$, when expressed in terms of the disc's orbital period, follows a tight power law with each criteria. In Milky Way-like discs embedded in live haloes, bars form within a Hubble time if $f_{\rm disc} \geq 0.18$, $t_{\rm OP} \geq 0.27$, and $\epsilon_{\rm ELN} \leq 1.44$. We show discs with higher velocity dispersion experience delayed bar growth and introduce an empirical relation that correctly describes the bar formation timescales of all our live halo models. Bars in static haloes grow at roughly half the rate of those in live haloes and require substantially greater disc instability to do so.
