#### LyαNNA II: Field-level inference with noisy Lyα forest spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Deep learning (DL) has been shown to outperform traditional, human-defined summary statistics of the Ly{\alpha} forest in constraining key astrophysical and cosmological parameters owing to its ability to tap into the realm of non-Gaussian information. An understanding of the impact of nuisance effects such as noise on such field-level frameworks, however, still remains elusive. In this work we conduct a systematic investigation into the efficacy of DL inference from noisy Ly{\alpha} forest spectra. Building upon our previous, proof-of-concept framework (Nayak et al. 2024) for pure spectra, we constructed and trained a ResNet neural network using labeled mock data from hydrodynamical simulations with a range of noise levels to optimally compress noisy spectra into a novel summary statistic that is exclusively sensitive to the power-law temperature-density relation of the intergalactic medium. We fit a Gaussian mixture surrogate with 23 components through our labels and summaries to estimate the joint data-parameter distribution for likelihood free inference, in addition to performing inference with a Gaussian likelihood. The posterior contours in the two cases agree well with each other. We compared the precision and accuracy of our posterior constraints with a combination of two human defined summaries (the 1D power spectrum and PDF of the Ly{\alpha} transmission) that have been corrected for noise, over a wide range of continuum-to-noise ratios (CNR) in the likelihood case. We found a gain in precision in terms of posterior contour area with our pipeline over the said combination of 65% (at a CNR of 20 per 6 km/s) to 112% (at 200 per 6 km/s). While the improvement in posterior precision is not as large as in the noiseless case, these results indicate that DL still remains a powerful tool for inference even with noisy, real-world datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 The removal of gas left over from star formation has long been thought to dominate the dynamical evolution, and dissolution of star-forming regions. Feedback from massive stars from their stellar winds, photoionising radiation and supernovae is postulated to expel significant amounts of gas, altering the gravitational potential energy of the star-forming region and causing a supervirial expansion, which disperses the stars into the Galaxy on rapid timescales (<10Myr). The majority of previous work has utilised N-body simulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal. Here, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback from massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also scale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or faster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We find that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink particles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a simulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we would expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the dynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities directly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with (sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback processes does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the expansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Central starbursts and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are thought to be fueled by either galaxy interactions or secular processes in gravitationally unstable discs. We employ cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project to propose a new nuclear fueling scenario based on the transition that galaxies undergo from bursty to smooth star formation and from prominent global galactic winds to inefficient stellar feedback as they grow above $M_{\star}\sim 10^{10-10.5}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$: the last major galactic wind event shuts down star formation, evacuates gas from the galaxy, and slows down gas accretion from the circumgalactic medium (CGM), creating a $\sim$$10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ pileup of gas in the inner CGM which later accretes coherently onto the galaxy, achieving a tenfold increase in inflow rate over pre-outflow conditions. We explicitly track the accumulation of gas along the outflow pathway owing to hydrodynamic interactions and show that $\sim$50% of gas fueling the central $\sim$10-100$\,{\rm pc}$ over the subsequent $\sim$15$\,{\rm Myr}$ can be traced back to pileup gas having experienced $>$50% change in infall velocity owing to the wind interaction. This galactic wind pileup effect may thus represent a significant fueling mode for compact starbursts and luminous AGN. Galactic winds at earlier times or AGN-driven outflows can have qualitatively similar effects, but the pileup of gas driven by the last major galactic wind event refuels the galaxy precisely when the deepening stellar potential prevents further gas evacuation by stellar feedback, providing the ideal conditions for quasar fueling at the time when AGN feedback is most needed to regulate central star formation in massive galaxies at their peak of activity.
#### Systematics mitigation for catalogue-based angular power spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work has developed a formalism for computing angular power spectra directly from catalogues containing field values at discrete positions on the sky, thereby circumventing the need to create pixelised maps of the fields, as well as avoiding aliasing and finite-resolution effects. Here, we adapt this formalism to incorporate template deprojection as a means of mitigating systematic biases in the measured angular power spectra. We also introduce and validate an alternative method of mitigating the so-called `deprojection bias', caused by the loss of modes after deprojection, employing the use of simple simulations to compute a transfer function. We find that this approach performs at least as well as existing methods, and is relatively insensitive to how well one can guess the true power spectrum of the observed field, except at the largest scales ($\ell \lesssim 3$). Additionally, we develop exact expressions for the bias introduced by deprojection in the shot-noise component, which further improves the accuracy of this approach. We test our formalism on simulated datasets, demonstrating its applicability both to discretely sampled fields, and to the special case of galaxy clustering, with the survey selection function defined in terms of a random catalogue or as a continuous sky map. After computing and removing the bias in the shot noise and using a transfer function to correct for the remaining mode loss, our formalism is able to produce unbiased measurements of the angular power spectrum in all scenarios tested here. Finally, we apply our formalism to real data and demonstrate that it produces results consistent with the standard map-based pseudo-$C_\ell$ formalism. We implement our method in the publicly available code NaMaster.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern cosmological simulations have now matured to the point of reproducing the evolution of realistic galaxy populations across cosmic time. These simulations rely on feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) to quench massive galaxies, yet the details of this process remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we introduce RAFIKI (Refining AGN Feedback In Kinetic Implementations), a novel suite of simulations built upon SIMBA-C that vary the mass loading of AGN-driven winds. Unlike the fiducial SIMBA-C simulation, RAFIKI separates the efficiencies of the two kinetic feedback modes, enabling a detailed study of their impact on galaxies, black holes, and the circumgalactic medium. We explore a range of galaxy and baryon properties in the RAFIKI runs and find that even with enhanced mass loading, the lower-velocity, quasar-type mode cannot quench massive galaxies. However, it plays a significant role in regulating black hole growth and star formation in intermediate-mass galaxies. We also uncover degeneracies in the parameter space that highlight the limited current constraints on AGN feedback. RAFIKI provides a controlled framework to disentangle these degeneracies using current and upcoming observations.
#### An accurate measure of the size of dark matter halos using the size of galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The physically motivated definition of galaxy size proposed recently, linked to the farther location of the in-situ star formation, considerably reduces the scatter of the galaxy mass-size relation, and provide a viable method to infer the galaxy stellar mass from its size. We provide a similar relation correlating the size of galaxies with the size of their dark matter haloes by leveraging the small scatter of the aforementioned relation. We analysed the simulated galaxies of the two main cosmological volumes of the EAGLE simulations, and computed the size of galaxies and their mass mimicking the observational analysis. For central galaxies, we computed the relation between galaxy size and halo size. We show that the simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar mass-size relation's normalisation and slope. The scatter of this relation, 0.06 dex, matches the intrinsic scatter measured in observation. We then computed the correlation between galaxy size and halo size, and found that the relation is steeper than when using the half-mass radius as measure of size, with the scatter (0.1 dex) a factor of two smaller than the observed relation. As well, the galaxy-to-halo mass relation derived from simulations provides a factor of two better scatter than observed. This opens the possibility of measuring the size of dark matter haloes with great accuracy (less than fifty percent, i.e. around six times better than using the effective radius) by using only deep imaging data.
#### Tidally-induced radial migration waves in LMC-like galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar radial migration has predominantly been examined in isolated disc galaxies where non-axisymmetric structures drive the process. By contrast, while tidal interactions are known for having an influence, their contribution remains comparatively under explored. The LMC, the nearest disc galaxy to the Milky Way (MW) and currently interacting with the SMC, provides a unique laboratory to investigate this interplay. We aim to quantify the impact of tidal interactions on radial migration and metallicity distribution in high-resolution simulations of LMC-like disc galaxies. We leverage a subsample of KRATOS, a suite of 28 pure $N$-body simulations of the LMC-SMC-MW system. Specifically, we use 6 simulations of both isolated and interacting LMC-like galaxies, exploring different values of the Toomre stellar parameter $Q$. These simulations allow to map the evolution of the stars' guiding radii $R_g(t)$ and compute radial migration fluxes in interacting systems and compare with their isolated counterparts, allowing to quantify the link between tidal interactions, radial migration, non-axisymmetric patterns, disc internal stability, and radial metallicity distribution. We present tidally-triggered wave-like radial migration fluxes reaching up to $\sim40\%$ of disc stellar mass per Gyr. This wave-like migration appears during the satellite's pericentre passages, almost independently of $Q$ and induces a metallicity drop of $\sim$3-5\% of the isolated galaxy's maximum metallicity in the inner disc. Additionally, in the isolated simulations, the extent of variation in the bar's resonance region coincides with the mixing zones in the metallicity distribution. We propose a novel description of a wave-like radial migration flux as a dynamical response of a galaxy undergoing tidal interactions and sketch its impact on the galaxy's metallicity distribution.
#### Rapid, out of equilibrium metal enrichment indicated by a flat mass-metallicity relation at z~6 from NIRCam grism spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR) known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at $5<z<7$. Using $\sim800$ [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities ($0.1$-$0.2\,\rm Z_\odot$ for M$_\star$ $\approx5\times10^{7-9}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX$^{20}$ and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 In a recent arXiv post, Hawkins & Garcia-Bellido raised doubts on the results of 20-yr long OGLE photometric monitoring, which did not find a large number of gravitational microlensing events in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds. These results implied that primordial black holes and other compact objects with masses from 10^{-8} to 10^3 M_solar cannot comprise a substantial fraction of the Milky Way dark matter halo. Unfortunately, the Hawkins & Garcia-Bellido post contained a number of scientific misrepresentations of our work. Here, we demonstrate that their arguments lack a solid basis or are simply incorrect. As we show below, "and yet they are not found" - compact objects (including primordial black holes) in the dark halo of the Milky Way remain undetected, despite extensive searches.
#### Understanding Interstellar Metals during Reionization with Radiative SPH Simulation: Metallicity and Emission Lines from the ISM at $10 \geq z \geq 5$

 - **Abstract**
 We compare the \texttt{Technicolor Dawn} cosmological simulations with recent observations of galactic nebular line emission during the Epoch of Reionization, providing stringent tests of the predicted ionization and metal enrichment levels. We validate the simulated population with the UVLF and $M_{\mathrm{UV}}-M_*$ relation and see that the simulated results are consistent with observations at lower masses. We extract local gas volumetric grids of density and mass-weighted metallicity, then we use \texttt{Cloudy} to produce synthetic emission spectra of \species{H}{ii} regions. The mass-metallicity relation does not evolve, which is also consistent with observations. The predicted oxygen abundance exceeds observational inferences by about 0.5 dex, suggesting either overly efficient enrichment or weak feedback. However, applying the O32 diagnostic directly to our synthetic spectra shows an offset of 1 dex from the correct outputted gas-phase metallicity. This suggests that O32 is biased high at a level that is more than sufficient to account for the simulation-observation offset. The simulated galaxies' line diagnostics show mostly weaker [\species{O}{iii}] lines and lower diagnostic values of O3 and Ne3O2 compared to observations. This suggests higher ionization parameters within the simulated galactic population in general.
#### MG-NECOLA: Fast Neural Emulators for Modified Gravity Cosmologies

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the large-scale structure (LSS) provide a powerful test of gravity on cosmological scales, but high-resolution N-body simulations of modified gravity (MG) are prohibitively expensive. We present MG-NECOLA, a convolutional neural network that enhances fast MG-PICOLA simulations to near-N-body fidelity at a fraction of the cost. MG-NECOLA reproduces QUIJOTE-MG N-body results in the power spectrum and bispectrum with better than 1% accuracy down to non-linear scales ($k \simeq 1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), while reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude. Importantly, although trained only on $f(R)$ models with massless neutrinos, the network generalizes robustly to scenarios with massive neutrinos, preserving accuracy to within 5% at non-linear scales. This combination of precision and robustness establishes MG-NECOLA as a practical emulator for producing large ensembles of high-fidelity simulations, enabling efficient exploration of modified gravity and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies in upcoming surveys.
#### Photometrically Selected Protocluster Candidates at z~9-10 in the JWST COSMOS-Web field

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift protoclusters are crucial for understanding the formation of galaxy clusters and the evolution of galaxies in dense environments. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its unprecedented near-infrared sensitivity, enables the first exploration of protoclusters beyond $z>$10. Among JWST surveys, COSMOS-Web Data Release 0.5 offers the largest area $\sim$0.27 deg$^2$, making it an optimal field for protocluster searches. In this study, we searched for protoclusters at $z\sim$9-10 using 366 F115W dropout galaxies. We evaluated the reliability of our photometric redshift by validation tests with the JADES DR3 spectroscopic sample, obtaining the likelihood of falsely identifying interlopers as $\sim25\%$. Overdensities ($\delta$) are computed by weighting galaxy positions with their photometric redshift probability density functions (PDF), using a 2.5 cMpc aperture and a redshift slice of $\pm$0.5. We selected the most promising core galaxies of protocluster candidate galaxies with an overdensity greater than the 95th percentile of the distribution of 366 F115W dropout galaxies. The member galaxies are then linked within an angular separation of 7.5 cMpc to the core galaxies, finding seven protocluster candidates. These seven protocluster candidates have inferred halo masses of $M_{\text{halo}} \sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. The detection of such overdensities at these redshifts provides a critical test for current cosmological simulations. However, confirming these candidates and distinguishing them from low-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies or Balmer-break galaxies will require follow-up near-infrared spectroscopic observations.
#### The chemodynamical memory of a major merger in a NIHAO-UHD Milky Way analogue II: Were Splash stars heated or already born hot?

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most debated consequences of the Milky Way's last major merger is the so-called $Splash$: stars with disc-like chemistry but halo-like kinematics, often interpreted as evidence for the violent heating of an early protodisc. Using the same high-resolution NIHAO-UHD cosmological simulation analysed in Buder et al. (2025b, hereafter Paper I), we test whether, and if so how, a Splash-like population arises in the Milky Way analogue. By tracing stellar birth positions, ages, and present-day orbits, we find that protodisc stars were already born on dynamically hot orbits, with no evidence for significant additional dynamical $splashing$ of these particular in-situ stars despite a 1:5 stellar mass merger. The observed Splash may therefore reflect the already turbulent early disc, subsequently intermixed with accreted stars and those formed from merger-driven gas inflows, rather than a distinct merger-heated population. When selecting stars with similar chemistry and age as the Splash-like ones, we find their azimuthal velocity distribution to be broad and positively skewed, with $V_\varphi = 73_{-59}^{+74}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The transition to a rotation-supported disc with large azimuthal velocities occurs only during or after the merger. Our results suggest an alternative to the proposed splashing scenario and highlight the need to disentangle the relative contributions of merger-induced heating and intrinsically hot disc formation to clarify the nature of Splash-like stars and their role in shaping the early Milky Way.
#### The effect of triaxiality on the dynamics of triple supermassive black holes in a cosmological context

 - **Abstract**
 The hierarchical nature of galaxy formation in the {\Lambda}CDM framework often leads to multiple supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the galactic nuclei. The timescale over which galaxies merge, plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamical evolution and the merger dynamics of their central SMBHs. While binary SMBH evolution is well studied, the long-term dynamics of triple SMBH systems, particularly in non-spherical potentials, remain less understood. We investigate the role of triaxiality in the evolution and dynamics of triple SMBHs with initial conditions drawn from the ROMULUS25 cosmological simulation, using high-resolution gravitodynamical N-body simulations. We explore different orbital configurations and host shapes, tracking the evolution from galactic inspiral to hard binary formation at sub-parsec scales. In all cases, the two most massive SMBHs form a rapidly hardening binary that coalesces within a fraction of a Hubble time, while the third forms a stable hierarchical triple system with the heavier binary, or remains on a wide orbit.
#### Observationally derived change in star-formation rate as mergers progress

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers can change the rate at which stars are formed. We can trace when these changes occur in simulations of galaxy mergers. However, for observed galaxies we do not know how the star-formation rate (SFR) evolves along the merger sequence as it is difficult to probe the time before or after coalescence. We aim to derive how SFR changes in observed mergers throughout the merger sequence, from a statistical perspective. Merger times were estimated for observed galaxy mergers in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained on mock KiDS images created using IllustrisTNG data. The SFRs were derived from spectral energy density fitting to KiDS and VIKINGs data. To determine the change in SFR for the merging galaxies, each merging galaxy was matched and compared to ten comparable non-merging galaxies; matching redshift, stellar mass, and local density. Mergers see an increase in SFR for galaxies from 300~Myr before the merger until coalescence, continuing until at least 200~Myr after the merger event. After this, there is a possibility that SFR activity in the mergers begins to decrease, but we need more data to better constrain our merger times and SFRs to confirm this. We find that more galaxies with larger stellar mass (M$_{\star}$) have greater SFR enhancement as they merge compared to lower M$_{\star}$ galaxies. There is no clear trend of changing SFR enhancement as local density changes, but the least dense environments have the least SFR enhancement. The increasing SFR enhancement is likely due to closer proximity of galaxies and the presence of more close passes as the time before merger approaches 0~Myr, with SFR slowing 200~Myr after the merger event.

 - **Abstract**
 The peculiar motions of massive halos probe the distribution of matter in the universe, the gravitational potential, and the history of cosmic structure growth. The kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect offers a robust observational window into these properties. The pairwise kSZ estimator probes the pairwise momentum of groups of galaxies by cross-correlating cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps with spectroscopic galaxy catalogs, using galaxies to trace the positions of dark matter halos. This note introduces iskay2, an efficient pipeline designed to apply the pairwise kSZ estimator to maps of the CMB and large galaxy catalogs. Pairwise kSZ measurements obtained using this pipeline are compared to previously published results and are shown to be consistent within statistical expectations. This pipeline will enable high-precision measurements of the pairwise kSZ utilizing galaxy catalogs like DESI combined with past, current and next-generation high-resolution CMB experiments such as ACT, SPT and the Simons Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are known to correlate with many properties of their host galaxies, but we do not fully understand these correlations. The strengths (tightness) of these correlations have also been widely debated. In this work, we explore SMBH-host relations in three state-of-the-art cosmological simulations: Illustris, TNG, and EAGLE. Using a variety of machine learning regressors, we measure the scaling relations between black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and galaxy properties including stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), dark matter halo mass ($M_{\rm Halo}$), and the Sersic index. We find that machine learning regressors provide predictive capabilities superior to linear regression in many scaling relations in simulations, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor has the strongest performance. SMBH-host relations have different strengths in different simulations as a result of their sub-grid models. Similar to the observations, the $M_{\rm BH} $-$\sigma$ relation is a strong correlation in all simulations, but in TNG, the $M_{\rm BH} $-$M_{\star}$ relation is even tighter than $M_{\rm BH} $-$\sigma$. EAGLE produces the weakest SMBH-host correlations among all simulations. Low mass SMBHs tend to be poorly correlated with their host galaxies, but including them can still help machines better grasp the correlations in Illustris and TNG. Combining galaxy properties that strongly correlate with $M_{\rm BH} $ but poorly correlate with each other can improve MLP's performance. $M_{\rm BH} $ is most accurately predicted when all galaxy properties are included in the training, suggesting that SMBH-host correlations are fundamentally multi-dimensional in these simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments aim to detect primordial gravitational waves with unprecedented sensitivity. Effective foreground removal is essential to avoid biases in the measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in this high-precision regime. Recent analyses highlight the unexpected complexity of synchrotron emission at low frequencies, underscoring the need for more sensitive low-frequency data. To address this challenge, the European Low-Frequency Survey (ELFS) initiative and the Simons Array collaboration propose installing two European low-frequency receivers on one of the Simons Array telescopes. These receivers will enable measurements in the Southern Hemisphere between $6$ and $20$,GHz, complementary to those of current and proposed experiments targeting the measurement of cosmological gravitational waves. In this work, we study the benefits of combining these low-frequency observations with a representative future CMB experiment operating from the Southern Hemisphere. We find that the extra information can improve the knowledge of the underlying synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED), with positive impacts on the robustness of measurement of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, against the complexity of low-frequency foregrounds.
