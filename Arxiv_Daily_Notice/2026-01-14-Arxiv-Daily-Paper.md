 - **Abstract**
 We introduce an effective framework to model star-formation burstiness and use it to jointly fit galaxy UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), clustering, and H$\alpha$/UV ratios, providing the first robust empirical evidence that early galaxies hosted in lower-mass halos are burstier. Using $z\sim 4-6$ observations, we find that galaxies show approximately $0.6$ dex of SFR variability if hosted in halos of $M_h = 10^{11}\, M_\odot$ (typical of $M_{\rm UV}\approx -19$ galaxies at $z = 6$). This translates into a scatter of $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}}\approx 0.75$ in the UVLF, in line with past findings. Strikingly, we find that burstiness grows for galaxies hosted in smaller halos, reaching $\gtrsim 1$ dex for $M_h \leq 10^{9}\, M_\odot$ (corresponding to $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}} \approx 1.5$ for faint $M_{\rm UV} \gtrsim -15$ galaxies). Extrapolating to higher redshifts, when small halos were more prevalent, the inferred mass-dependent burstiness can reproduce observed UVLFs up to $z\sim 17$ within 1$\sigma$, potentially alleviating the tension between pre- and post-JWST galaxy-formation models. Current observations allow us to constrain burst timescales to approximately $20$ Myr, consistent with expectations from supernova feedback, and suggest broad distributions of ionizing efficiencies at fixed $M_{\rm UV}$. Our results demonstrate that mass-dependent burstiness, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations, is critical for understanding the mass assembly of early galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the formation of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), potential seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs), via runaway stellar collisions for a wide range of star cluster (surface) densities ($4\times10^3 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2} \lesssim \Sigma_\mathrm{h}$ $\lesssim 4\times10^6 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$) and metallicities ($0.01 Z_\odot \lesssim Z \lesssim 1.0 Z_\odot)$. Our sample of isolated $(>1400)$ and hierarchical ($30$) simulations of young, massive star clusters with up to $N=1.8\times10^6$ stars includes collisional stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, and post-Newtonian equations of motion for black holes using the BIFROST code. High stellar wind rates suppress IMBH formation at high metallicities $(Z \gtrsim 0.2 Z_\odot)$ and low collision rates prevent their formation at low densities ($\Sigma_\mathrm{h} \lesssim 3\times10^4 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$). The assumptions about stellar wind loss rates strongly affect the maximum final IMBH masses $(M_\bullet \sim 6000 M_\odot$ vs. $25000 M_\odot$). The total stellar mass loss from collisions and collisionally boosted winds before $t=3$ Myr can together reach up to 5-10% of the final cluster mass. We present fitting formulae for IMBH masses as a function of host star cluster $\Sigma_\mathrm{h}$ and Z, and formulate a model for the cosmic IMBH formation rate density. Depending on the cluster birth densities, the IMBH formation rates peak at $z\sim2$-$4$ at up to $\sim10^{-7}$ yr$^{-1}$cMpc$^{-3}$. As more than 50% form below $z\lesssim1.5$-$3$, the model challenges a view in which all local IMBHs are failed early Universe SMBH seeds.
#### Sahyadri: A simulation suite for the cosmology dependence of the Cosmic Web

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07924

 - **Abstract**
 We present Sahyadri, a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations designed to enable precision studies of the low-redshift Universe with next-generation spectroscopic surveys. Sahyadri includes systematic variations of six cosmological parameters around Planck 2018 constraints, with seed-matched initial conditions enabling cosmological parameter derivatives. Each simulation evolves $2048^3$ particles in a periodic box of side length $200$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, yielding a particle mass of $m_{\rm{p}} = 8.1 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial Planck 2018 cosmology. This resolution enables robust identification of dark matter halos down to $M_{\rm min} = 3.2 \times 10^{9}$ $h^{-1}$ $M_\odot$, which represents a factor of $\sim$25 improvement over the AbacusSummit suite, and is over two orders of magnitude better than the Quijote and Aemulus suites. We estimate that approximately 40% of DESI BGS galaxies at redshift $z < 0.15$ - roughly 1.6 million objects - reside in halos accessible to Sahyadri but beyond the reach of existing parameter-varying simulation suites. We demonstrate Sahyadri's capabilities through measurements of the matter power spectrum, halo mass function and power spectrum, and beyond 2-point statistics such as the Voronoi volume function and $k^{\rm th}$ nearest neighbour statistics, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and significant sensitivity to $\Omega_{\rm m}$ variations. We implement a custom compression scheme reducing storage requirements by a factor of $\sim$3 while maintaining sub-percent clustering accuracy. Key data products will be made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cosmic voids are underdense regions of the Universe that provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution in relative isolation. Galaxy triplets in voids are rare systems where local interactions may strongly influence galaxy properties. Aims. We study the stellar populations, morphologies, mass assembly histories, and dynamical properties of six galaxies belonging to two void triplets from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY): CAVITY5273X and VGS31. Methods. We used integral-field unit spectroscopy and performed full spectral fitting with the FADO code, which models stellar and nebular emission simultaneously. Spatially resolved maps of stellar age, metallicity, and star formation rate were reconstructed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation. Morphological properties were derived using morfometryka, emission-line diagnostics were applied, and mass assembly functions were computed. Stellar masses and metallicities were compared to the mass-metallicity relation for void galaxies. Results. The two triplets show different evolutionary behaviours. CAVITY52731 is a massive quenched galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus, while its companions and all galaxies in VGS31 are dominated by young stellar populations and recent star formation. Five galaxies experienced rapid stellar mass growth in the last 2 Gyr. Disturbed morphologies, including asymmetries and tidal features, indicate ongoing interactions. Galaxies in CAVITY5273X follow the expected void mass-metallicity relation, while VGS31 members show significant deviations. Conclusions. Our results show that local interactions can drive significant galaxy evolution even in the most underdense cosmic environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) glossary is vast and complex. Depending on selection method, observing wavelength, and brightness, AGNs are assigned distinct labels, yet the relationship between different selection methods and the diversity of time-domain behavior within and across classes remains difficult to characterize in a unified framework. Changing-look AGNs (CLAGNs), which transition between classifications over time, further complicate this picture. In this work, we learn a data-driven, low-dimensional representation of multi-wavelength photometric light curves of AGNs, in which the structure of the projected manifold correlates with AGN class and independent spectroscopic properties. Using the NASA Fornax Science Platform, we assemble light curves from ZTF, Pan-STARRS, Gaia, and WISE/NEOWISE for two samples: (1) a heterogeneous set of $\sim$2000 AGNs spanning $z \lesssim 1$, including SDSS quasars, variability-selected sources, and CLAGNs; and (2) a homogeneous sample of $\sim$65000 narrow-line AGNs at $z \approx 0.1$ with well-characterized optical emission-line measurements. Without using class labels during training, the learned manifolds organize variability-selected AGNs into coherent regions of the low-dimensional space, distinguish between turn-on and turn-off CLAGNs, and place tidal disruption events in distinct regions. Manifold coordinates correlate with key spectroscopic and host-galaxy properties, including stellar mass, [OIII] luminosity, and D$_n$(4000), demonstrating that heterogeneous multi-band variability can be combined in a purely data-driven manner to recover correlations with independent physical diagnostics, without requiring explicit physical modeling. These results show that manifold learning offers a practical, assumption-light approach for integrating time-domain surveys and prioritizing spectroscopic follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 With upcoming facilities capable of detecting photometric and gravitational wave signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, studying their long-term accretion-driven variability is timely. OJ287 is a bright, nearby ($z=0.3$), and well-studied candidate for a SMBH binary. As such, it is an excellent case study for how binary dynamics could influence observed active galactic nucleus (AGN) photometric variability. We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of OJ287, using the code PHANTOM. We simulate two mass ratios: (i) M$_1$ $=$ 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ with M$_2$ $=$ 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$, (ii) M$_1\approx$ M$_2$ ($\sim10^{8}$ M$_\odot$) along and (iii) control of a single SMBH and accretion disc. We find that the simulation with masses 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$ evolves consistently with the most currently accepted model of OJ287 as a precessing SMBH binary. The secondary's impacts with the disc result in the formation of spiral density waves and a corresponding $\sim$10-20% increases in the mass accretion rate of the primary SMBH. The impact timings and the mass accretion rate spikes show quasi-periodic variability as a result of the precession of the secondary's orbit with intervals between impacts ranging from $\sim$ 1 year to $\sim$ 10 years. In the near-equal mass case, the disc of the primary becomes tidally disrupted after $\sim$ 2 years. Consequently, the near-equal mass system with a period of 12 years is not a viable candidate for OJ287. This modeling provides insights into the potential signatures of SMBH binaries by both gravitational wave observatories and the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters are well known for their dynamical interactions, an outcome of their high stellar densities; in this paper we use multiwavelength observations to search for the unique outcomes of these interactions in three nearby Galactic open clusters: IC 2602 (30 Myr), NGC 2632 (750 Myr) and M67 (4 Gyr). We compared X-ray observations from all-sky surveys like eROSITA, plus archival observations from Chandra X-ray Observatory, survey radio observations from ASKAP's Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey plus archival VLA observations, in conjunction with new cluster catalogs with Gaia. From X-ray, we found 77 X-ray sources likely associated with IC 2602, 31 X-ray sources in NGC 2632, and 31 near M67's central regions. We were further able to classify these X-ray sources based on their optical variability and any radio emission. Three IC 2602 X-ray sources had radio counterparts, which are likely all chromospherically active binary stars. We also identified luminous radio and X-ray variability from a spectroscopic triple system in M67, WOCS 3012/S1077, which is either consistent with a quiescent black hole binary, or due to an active binary stellar system. A recent population study of optical variables by Anderson & Hunt 2025 shows that the population of optical variables in open clusters clearly changes over cluster age; this pilot study gives evidence that the X-ray population also changes with time, and demonstrates the need for a broader multiwavelength study of Galactic open clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The parameters of an axisymmetric model for the gravitational potential of the Galaxy have been refined. The basic curve of the Galaxy's rotation in a distance interval of $R:0-190$ kpc was constructed using the velocities of masers, classical Cepheids, Red Clump stars, Blue Horizontal Branch stars, halo stars, globular clusters, and dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. The rotation curve was selected in such a way that there would be no dominant burst of circular velocities in the central ($R<2$ kpc) region of the Galaxy. As a result, we constructed two two-component models of the galactic potential, which include contributions from the disk and the halo of invisible matter, as well as a three-component model with a small-mass bulge added in advance. These models can be useful in studying the long-term orbital evolution of stars and open and globular star clusters in the central ($R<4$ kpc) region of the Galaxy. The constructed models were tested for self-consistency by comparing their rotation curves with a set of model curves generated with the Illustris TNG50 software package.

 - **Abstract**
 Our Local Group, dominated in mass by the Milky Way (MW) and M31, provides a unique laboratory for testing $\Lambda$CDM cosmology on small scales owing to its proximity. However, its connection to the surrounding large-scale environment, which is essential for interpreting its properties, is inadequately understood. In this work, we explore the connection between Local Group analogues (LGAs) and their surrounding large-scale environments using the ABACUSSUMMIT simulation suite, highlighting the key role of the coupling energy of the MW-M31 orbit, $E_{\rm coupling}$. We find that LGAs with high $E_{\rm coupling}$ preferentially reside in denser regions, whereas those with low $E_{\rm coupling}$ tend to occupy low-density environments. Furthermore, LGAs with low $E_{\rm coupling}$ exhibit strong alignment with cosmic filaments, manifested as a pronounced polar anisotropy in the distribution of tracer haloes. By contrast, LGAs with high $E_{\rm coupling}$ show a weaker polar anisotropy but an enhanced azimuthal anisotropy, with large-scale tracer haloes preferentially lying in the plane spanned by the halo pair and the orbital spin vector. Within this framework, our Local Group is characterised by typical $E_{\rm coupling}$ residing in a relatively under-dense environment, yet it remains consistent with the 95\% range of analogue systems identified in the simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful probe of the cosmic expansion history far beyond the redshift range accessible to Type Ia supernovae. However, the calibration of GRB luminosity correlations is hindered by the circularity problem, which arises from assuming a fiducial cosmological model during calibration. In this work, we perform a model independent calibration of GRB luminosity relations using observational Hubble parameter H(z) data from the A220 and J220 compilations, thereby avoiding explicit cosmological assumptions. We employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct the calibration relation directly from the data. In addition, we implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) framework as an alternative approach, enabling a data driven treatment of both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The calibrated GRB sample is used to constrain the Amati relation, and we systematically compare the outcomes obtained from different calibration techniques and datasets. While the Amati Parameters obtained from GRBs caibrated from the ANN and BNN results are consistent with previous low redshifts calibrations using model-independent methods, the BNN approach provides a more robust framework.
#### Stellar masses of optically dark galaxies: uncertainty introduced by the attenuation law and star-formation histories

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations have suggested that some high-redshift galaxies may be ultra-massive, thereby challenging standard models of early galaxy formation and cosmology. We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with $z>5$. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=3.2461^{+0.0001}_{-0.0002}$, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool \texttt{Prospector}, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \approx 10.36^{+0.47}_{-0.32}, 10.95^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ and $10.31^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$ for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources. Nevertheless, even with these revised stellar mass estimates, two of the three galaxies remain among the most massive and actively star-forming systems at their respective redshifts, implying high star-formation efficiencies.
#### A precessing jet from an active galactic nucleus drives gas outflow from a disk galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 To reproduce observed galaxy properties, cosmological simulations require that massive galaxies experience feedback from active galactic nuclei, which regulates star formation within those galaxies. However, the energetics and timescales of these feedback processes are poorly constrained. We combine optical, infrared, sub-millimeter and radio observations of the active galaxy VV 340a, hosting a low-power jet launched from a supermassive black hole at its center. We find that the jet undergoes precession, with a period of (8.2 $\pm~$5.5) $\times~$10$^5$ years, and drives an outflow of gas at a rate of 19.4 $\pm~$7.9 solar masses per year. The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma extending several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star formation rate.
