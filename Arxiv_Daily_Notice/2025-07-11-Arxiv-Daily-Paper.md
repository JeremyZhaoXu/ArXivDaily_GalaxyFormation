 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations of massive galaxies at z > 2 have detected blueshifted absorption in Na I D and other resonant absorption lines, indicative of strong gas outflows in the neutral phase. However, the measured mass outflow rates are highly uncertain because JWST observations can only probe the column density of trace elements such as sodium, while most of the gas is in the form of hydrogen. The conversion between the column density of sodium and that of hydrogen is based on observations of gas clouds within the Milky Way, and has not been directly tested for massive galaxies at high redshift. In order to test this conversion, we study a unique system consisting of a massive quiescent galaxy (J1439B) at z = 2.4189 located at a projected distance of 38 physical kpc from the bright background quasar QSO J1439. The neutral outflow from the galaxy is observed as a sub-damped Lyman-alpha absorber in the spectrum of the background quasar, which enables a direct measurement of the hydrogen column density from Lyman transitions. We obtain new near-infrared spectroscopy with Magellan/FIRE and detect Na I D and other resonant absorption lines from Mg II, Mg I, and Fe II. We are thus able to derive new, empirical calibrations between the column density of trace elements and the hydrogen column density, that can be used to estimate the mass and the rate of neutral gas outflows in other massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift. The calibration we derive for Na I is only 30% lower than the local relation that is typically assumed at high redshift, confirming that the neutral outflows observed with JWST at z > 2 are able to remove a large amount of gas and are thus likely to play a key role in galaxy quenching. However, using the local calibration for Mg II yields an order-of-magnitude discrepancy compared to the empirical calibration, possibly because of variations in the dust depletion.

 - **Abstract**
 Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \le 60$ deg, $10 \le |b| \le 60$ deg) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a sharp peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which does not depend on GALPROP or other model templates. The halo excess can be fitted by the annihilation spectrum with a mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey seeks to curate a large, comprehensive, uniform dataset of open clusters and member stars to constrain key Galactic parameters. This eighth entry from the OCCAM survey, based on the newly released SDSS-V/MWM Data Release 19 (DR19), has established a sample of 164 high quality open clusters that are used to constrain the radial and azimuthal gradients of the Milky Way. The DR19 cluster sample [Fe/H] abundances are roughly consistent with measurements from other large-scale spectroscopic surveys. However, the gradients we calculate deviate considerably for some elements. We find an overall linear Galactic radial [Fe/H] gradient of $-0.075 \pm 0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the cluster's current Galactocentric Radius ($R_{GC}$) and a gradient of $-0.068 \pm 0.005$ dex kpc$^-1$ with respect to the cluster's guiding center radius. We do not find strong evidence for significant evolution of the differential element gradients ([X/Fe]) investigated here (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Na, Al, K, Ce, Nd). For the first time using the OCCAM sample we have sufficient numbers of clusters to investigate Galactic azimuthal variations. In this work, we do find evidence of azimuthal variations in the measured radial abundance gradient in the Galactic disk using our open cluster sample.

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of galaxy formation posits a clear correlation between the spin of galaxies and the orientation of the elements of the large-scale structure of the Universe, particularly cosmic filaments. A substantial number of observational and modelling studies have been undertaken with the aim of identifying the dependence of spin orientation on the components of the large-scale structure. However, the findings of these studies remain contradictory. In this paper, we present an analysis of the orientation of the spins of 2 861 galaxies with respect to the filaments of the large-scale structure of the Universe. All galaxies in our sample have an inclination to the line of sight greater than 85 degrees, enabling an unambiguous determination of the spin axis direction in space. We investigate the alignment of galaxy spin axes relative to cosmic web filaments as a function of various properties for galaxies. Our results reveal a statistically significant tendency for the galaxy spin axes to align along the filament axes of the large-scale structure.
#### AT2019cmw: A highly luminous, cooling featureless TDE candidate from the disruption of a high mass star in an early-type galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical/UV photometric and spectroscopic observations, as well as X-ray and radio follow-up, of the extraordinary event AT2019cmw. With a peak bolometric luminosity of ~$\mathrm{10^{45.6}\,erg\,s^{-1}}$, it is one of the most luminous thermal transients ever discovered. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up post-peak showed only a featureless continuum throughout its evolution. This, combined with its nuclear location, blue colour at peak and lack of prior evidence of an AGN in its host lead us to interpret this event as a `featureless' tidal disruption event (TDE). It displays photometric evolution atypical of most TDEs, cooling from ~30 kK to ~10 kK in the first ~300 days post-peak, with potential implications for future photometric selection of candidate TDEs. No X-ray or radio emission is detected, placing constraints on the presence of on-axis jetted emission or a visible inner-accretion disk. Modelling the optical light curve with existing theoretical prescriptions, we find that AT2019cmw may be the result of the disruption of a star in the tens of solar masses by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Combined with a lack of detectable star formation in its host galaxy, it could imply the existence of a localised region of star formation around the SMBH. This could provide a new window to probe nuclear star formation and the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) in close proximity to SMBHs out to relatively high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity stars are interesting targets to unveil the formation of the Milky Way. In fact they can be recently accreted from an infalling dwarf galaxies or they can be the result of a turbulent merging of galaxies. Gaia is providing the community a way to select stars for their kinematics and the radial velocity, one of the speed components, is derived from the Gaia RVS spectrum. High absolute radial velocity values are sensitive to be false positive. They are rare and as such they are more easily impacted than lower velocity stars, by contamination by very low SNR spurious measures. We here investigate a sample of 26 stars with Gaia absolute radial velocity in excess of 500___km/s with spectroscopic follow-up observations with UVES. For all but one star the extreme radial velocity is confirmed and these stars are all metal-poor and, as expected, enhanced in the elements. The complete chemical inventory confirm the large star-to-star scatter for the heavy elements and their on average larger ratio over iron with respect to the Sun, in agreement with the literature.
#### Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disks II: Merger Probability of Binary Black Holes during Chaotic Triple Process

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single interactions\,(BSIs) in active galactic nucleus\,(AGN) disks are a potential source of gravitational wave\,(GW) events with measurable eccentricities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of 1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian \emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\sim$5, from 4\% to as high as 20\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a timescale of $\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an improved baryonification (BFC) model that modifies dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations to generate particle-level outputs for gas, dark matter, and stars. Unlike previous implementations, our approach first splits each simulation particle into separate dark matter and baryonic components, which are then displaced individually using the BFC technique. By applying the hydrostatic and ideal gas equations, we assign pressure and temperature values to individual gas particles. The model is validated against hydrodynamical simulations from the FLAMINGO and TNG suites (which feature varied feedback prescriptions) showing good agreement at the level of density and pressure profiles across a wide range of halo masses. As a further step, we calibrate the BFC model parameters to gas and stellar mass ratio profiles from the hydrodynamical simulations. Based on these calibrations, we baryonify $N$-body simulations and compare the resulting total matter power spectrum suppressions to the ones from the same hydrodynamical simulation. Carrying out this test of the BFC method at each redshift individually, we obtain a 2 percent agreement up to $k=5\,h$/Mpc across all tested feedback scenarios. We also define a reduced, 2+1 parameter BFC model that simultaneously accounts for feedback variations (2 parameters) and redshift evolution (1 parameter). The 2+1 parameter model agrees with the hydrodynamical simulations to better than 2.5 percent over the scales and redshifts relevant for cosmological surveys. Finally, we present a map-level comparison between a baryonified $N$-body simulation and a full hydrodynamical run from the TNG simulation suite. Visual inspection of dark matter, gas, and stellar density fields, along with the integrated pressure map, shows promising agreement. Further work is needed to quantify the accuracy at the level of observables.
#### A Semi-Analytic model for Effects of Fuzzy Dark Matter Granule Perturbations on Orbital Motion

 - **Abstract**
 In fuzzy dark matter scenarios, the quantum wave nature of ultralight axion-like particles generates stochastic density fluctuations inside dark matter halos. These fluctuations, known as granules, perturb the orbits of subhalos and other orbiting bodies. While previous studies have simulated these effects using N-body techniques or modeled them statistically using diffusion approximations, we propose an alternative framework based on representing the perturbations as a Fourier series with random coefficients, which can be applied to individual orbits, not just populations. We extend the model to finite-size subhalos, identifying a critical length scale below which subhalos behave as point-mass particles. In contrast, larger subhalos exhibit suppressed perturbations from granules due to their extended mass profiles. Using FDM-Simulator, we validate our finite-size model by isolating granule accelerations and confirming their statistical effects on subhalo dynamics.
#### Baryonification II: Constraining feedback with X-ray and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic feedback alters the matter distribution on small and intermediate scales, posing a challenge for precision cosmology. The new, component-wise baryonification (BFC) approach provides a self-consistent framework to model feedback effects for different observables. In this paper we use this framework to fit kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) alongside halo X-ray gas fractions from eROSITA, investigating baryonic feedback in a cosmological context. We first show that the kSZ data from ACT is consistent with the gas fractions from eROSITA, both suggesting a feedback model that is stronger than what is assumed in most hydrodynamical simulations. This finding is in contrast to older, pre-eROSITA gas fraction measurements that point towards weaker feedback in tension with the kSZ results. We suspect these discrepancies to be due to selection bias in the pre-eROSITA sample, or differences in halo mass estimation between the two data sets. In a further step, we use the BFC model to predict the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum. Based on our combined fit to data from ACT and eROSITA, we find a power spectrum suppression that exceeds the percent-level at modes above $k=0.3-0.6 \,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, growing to 2-8 percent at $k=1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and to 20-25 percent at $k=5\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, consistent with strong-feedback hydrodynamical simulations. Finally, we compare our best-fitting model to the observed gas density and pressure profiles of massive galaxy clusters from the X-COP sample, finding excellent agreement. These results show that BFC provides a self-consistent picture of feedback across mass- and length scales as well as different cosmological observables, thus making it promising for applications to multiwavelength studies to jointly constrain cosmology and baryonic effects.
