 (Edited) We introduce a flexible framework for building gravitational wave (GW) event catalogs in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. Our framework couples the state-of-the-art binary population synthesis code SEVN with Arepo-GW -- a module fully integrated into the moving-mesh code Arepo -- to assign merger events of binary compact objects to stellar particles in simulations by stochastically sampling merger tables generated with SEVN. Arepo-GW supports both on-the-fly operation, producing event catalogs during simulations, and post-processing, using snapshots from existing runs. The algorithm is fully parallel and can be readily adapted to outputs from other simulation codes. To demonstrate the capabilities of our new framework, we applied Arepo-GW in post-processing to simulations from the MillenniumTNG suite, including its flagship box. We investigate key properties of the resulting GW event catalog, built on SEVN predictions, focusing on comoving merger rates, formation efficiencies, delay-time distributions, and progenitor mass and metallicity distributions. We also examine how these properties vary with simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated star formation histories and are generally consistent with current observational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\sim 4.5$ excess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger rates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates for $z \lesssim 1$. Finally, the analysis of progenitor mass functions across different formation channels reveals only mild redshift evolution, while the binary black hole mass function displays features compatible with current observational determinations. These findings highlight the potential of our novel framework to enable detailed predictions for upcoming GW surveys within a full cosmological context.
#### Comparing XRISM cluster velocity dispersions with predictions from cosmological simulations: are feedback models too ejective?

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM), the hot plasma that fills galaxy clusters, are shaped by gravity-driven cluster mergers and feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBH) in the cluster cores. XRISM measurements of ICM velocities in several clusters offer insights into these processes. We compare XRISM measurements for nine galaxy clusters (Virgo, Perseus, Centaurus, Hydra A, PKS\,0745--19, A2029, Coma, A2319, Ophiuchus) with predictions from three state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suites, TNG-Cluster, The Three Hundred Project GADGET-X, and GIZMO-SIMBA, that employ different models of feedback. In cool cores, XRISM reveals systematically lower velocity dispersions than the simulations predict, with all ten measurements below the median simulated values by a factor $1.5-1.7$ on average and all falling within the bottom $10\%$ of the predicted distributions. The observed kinetic-to-total pressure ratio is also lower, with a median value of $2.2\%$, compared to the predicted $5.0-6.5\%$ for the three simulations. Outside the cool cores and in non-cool-core clusters, simulations show better agreement with XRISM measurements, except for the outskirts of the relaxed, cool-core cluster A2029, which exhibits an exceptionally low kinetic pressure support ($<1\%$), with none of the simulated systems in either of the three suites reaching such low levels. The non-cool-core Coma and A2319 exhibit dispersions at the lower end but within the simulated spread. Our comparison suggests that the three numerical models may overestimate the kinetic effects of SMBH feedback in cluster cores. Additional XRISM observations of non-cool-core clusters will clarify if there is a systematic tension in the gravity-dominated regime as well.
#### A Walk on the Retrograde Side (WRS) project. II. Chemistry to disentangle in situ and accreted components in Thamnos

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the first systematic and dedicated high-resolution chemical analysis of the Thamnos substructure, a candidate relic of the process of hierarchical merger of the Milky Way. The analysis is perfomed in comparison with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) remnant, within the fully self-consistent and homogeneous framework established by the WRS project. We analyse high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with UVES at VLT for 212 Red Giant Branch stars classified as candidate members of Thamnos and GSE, based on selections in the space of the integrals of motion. We derive precise abundances for 16 atomic species. Compared to GSE, stars attributed to the Thamnos substructure are, on average, more metal-poor, yet most of them show relatively higher [X/Fe] abundance ratios in several elements, like Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Cu, Zn, as well as lower [Eu/Fe]. The majority of candidate Thamnos stars show chemical signatures more consistent with the in situ Milky Way halo rather than a typical low-mass accreted dwarf galaxy. Our findings are further supported by comparisons with tailored galactic chemical evolution models, which fall short in reproducing the observed enhancement in the $\alpha$-elements, but are able to fit the more metal-poor component present in the Thamnos substructure. These results confirm a high level of contamination in the Thamnos substructure from the in situ population and to a lesser degree from GSE, while still leaving room for a genuine accreted population from a small disrupted dwarf galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present integral field spectroscopy of ionized gas components in AGC 111629, an edge-on low surface brightness galaxy (LSBG) with a stellar mass of 5.7$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. AGC 111629 displays an irregular H$\alpha$ morphology and an arch-like structure in the extraplanar region, which is absent in continuous stellar image. The irregular H$\alpha$ morphology may be related to a past merger event with its satellite galaxy AGC 748815. A peanut-shaped structure at the center in the integrated [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map, with a position angle that differs from that of the main stellar disk. This structure exhibits a higher [OIII]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ flux ratio, a larger equivalent width (EW) of [OIII]$\lambda$5007, and a lower H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ flux radio ($<$ 2.86). Some spaxels associated with the peanut-shaped structure fall within the composite region of the BPT diagram based on [NII]$\lambda$6583. These features may be associated with the central AGN. Additionally, a sub-peak in the southern disk is clearly visible in the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 map. An extended region ($\sim$ 2 kpc) with an extremely low value of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ flux ratio is observed near this sub-peak. We interpret the sub-peak as a superbubble likely driven by supernova explosions in the southern disk. We derive the gas-phase metallicity, 12+log(O/H), using the [NII]$\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ diagnostic and find that AGC 111629 exhibits low central metallicity. This may result from feedback associated with AGN activity and supernova explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 The potential of deep learning-based image-to-image translations has recently attracted significant attention. One possible application of such a framework is as a fast, approximate alternative to cosmological simulations, which would be particularly useful in various contexts, including covariance studies, investigations of systematics, and cosmological parameter inference. To investigate different aspects of learning-based cosmological mappings, we choose two approaches for generating suitable cosmological matter fields as datasets: a simple analytical prescription provided by the Zel'dovich approximation, and a numerical N-body method using the Particle-Mesh approach. The evolution of structure formation is modeled using U-Net, a widely employed convolutional image translation framework. Because of the lack of a controlled methodology, validation of these learned mappings requires multiple benchmarks beyond simple visual comparisons and summary statistics. A comprehensive list of metrics is considered, including higher-order correlation functions, conservation laws, topological indicators, and statistical independence of density fields. We find that the U-Net approach performs well only for some of these physical metrics, and accuracy is worse at increasingly smaller scales, where the dynamic range in density is large. By introducing a custom density-weighted loss function during training, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the U-Net results at smaller scales. This study provides an example of how a family of physically motivated benchmarks can, in turn, be used to fine-tune optimization schemes -- such as the density-weighted loss used here -- to significantly enhance the accuracy of scientific machine learning approaches by focusing attention on relevant features.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of Pop. III formation in the MEGATRON suite of simulations, which self-consistently follows radiation and non-equilibrium chemistry, and resolves gas at near-pc resolution of a Milky Way-mass halo at Cosmic Dawn. While the very first Pop. III stars form in halos with masses well below the atomic cooling limit, whose cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen, the majority of Pop. III stars form in more massive systems above the $10^4$~K atomic cooling threshold. The shift in cooling regime of halos hosting new Pop. III stars occurs within $100$ Myr of the first Pop. III star as the Lyman-Werner (LW) background rapidly increases to $10^{-21}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,Hz^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$. We find that the global Pop. III star formation rate stabilizes to a value of $10^{-3}\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$ at $z=20$. Among the three processes that quench Pop. III star formation in mini-halos, the LW background, gas starvation, and external chemical enrichment, the LW background is most important. A small fraction of haloes undergo multiple episodes of Pop. III star formation when the earlier forming stars all directly collapse to black holes. If the halos become massive enough, they can form up to $\sim100$ Pop. III stars in a single burst, which may be observable by JWST with moderate gravitational lensing. Pop. III stars form at a wide range of distances from UV-bright galaxies, with only $0.06\%$ of Pop. III stars forming within the virial radius of galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} < -17$. Finally, by tracking Pop. III star remnants down to $z=0$, we find that $75-80\,$% reside in the stellar halo of our simulated Milky Way analogue, while the remainder are gravitationally bound to lower-mass systems, including satellite halos.

 - **Abstract**
 A tight correlation between the baryonic and observed acceleration of galaxies has been reported over a wide range of mass ($10^8 < M_{\rm bar}/{\rm M}_\odot < 10^{11}$) - the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR). This has been interpreted as evidence that dark matter is actually a manifestation of some modified weak-field gravity theory. In this paper, we study the radially resolved RAR of 12 nearby dwarf galaxies, with baryonic masses in the range $10^4 < M_{\rm bar}/{\rm M}_\odot < 10^{7.5}$, using a combination of literature data and data from the MUSE-Faint survey. We use stellar line-of-sight velocities and the Jeans modelling code GravSphere to infer the mass distributions of these galaxies, allowing us to compute the RAR. We compare the results with the EDGE simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies with similar stellar masses in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that most of the observed dwarf galaxies lie systematically above the low-mass extrapolation of the RAR. Each galaxy traces a locus in the RAR space that can have a multi-valued observed acceleration for a given baryonic acceleration, while there is significant scatter from galaxy to galaxy. Our results indicate that the RAR does not apply to low-mass dwarf galaxies and that the inferred baryonic acceleration of these dwarfs does not contain enough information, on its own, to derive the observed acceleration. The simulated EDGE dwarfs behave similarly to the real data, lying systematically above the extrapolated RAR. We show that, in the context of modified weak-field gravity theories, these results cannot be explained by differential tidal forces from the Milky Way, nor by the galaxies being far from dynamical equilibrium, since none of the galaxies in our sample seems to experience strong tides. As such, our results provide further evidence for the need for invisible dark matter in the smallest dwarf galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of stars with light-element abundance variations in globular clusters and the subsequent dynamical evolution of these multiple populations remains an open question. One of the most widely discussed is the AGB scenario, in which chemically processed material from the envelopes of AGB stars mixes with re-accreted primordial gas flowing into the center of the cluster. Based on this scenario, more than two hundred MOCCA simulations of cluster evolution have been carried out, incorporating additional physical processes related to the external environment of globular clusters and the initial properties of multiple stellar populations. Analysis of the simulations shows that most observed properties of multiple stellar populations and the global parameters of Milky Way clusters are well reproduced, with the exception of the correlation between cluster mass and the fraction of second-population stars. We present a speculative scenario of globular cluster evolution that may account for the observed properties of Milky Way clusters, including the correlation between cluster mass and the fraction of enriched stars. The scenario further predicts that, under certain conditions, the pristine first population can be more centrally concentrated than the enriched second population, as observed in some clusters. \end{abstract

 - **Abstract**
 We present our photometric method, which combines Subaru/HSC $NB515$, g, and i band filters to distinguish giant stars in Local Group galaxies from Milky Way dwarf contamination. The $NB515$ filter is a narrow-band filter that covers the MgI+MgH features at $5150$ Å, and is sensitive to stellar surface gravity. Using synthetic photometry derived from large empirical stellar spectral libraries, we model the $NB515$ filter's sensitivity to stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances. Our results demonstrate that the $NB515$ filter effectively separates dwarfs from giants, even for the reddest and coolest M-type stars. To further enhance this separation, we develop machine learning models that improve the classification on the two-color ($g-i$, $NB515-g$) diagram. We apply these models to photometric data from the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy and two fields of M31, successfully identifying red giant branch stars in these galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia collaboration announced the discovery of a massive black hole (BH) with a low-mass giant star companion, Gaia BH3, located in the ED-2 stellar stream. The properties of Gaia BH3 bridge the gap between known Milky Way BHs and extragalactic BHs found with gravitational waves (GWs). We aim to determine the most likely formation scenario for Gaia BH3 in the progenitor cluster of the ED-2 stream. We perform $N$-body simulations of that progenitor cluster and find that, most likely, Gaia BH3 formed from a stellar binary that formed during cluster formation, which then underwent multiple dynamical interactions that significantly altered its properties, including exchanging the companion star. We highlight the importance of cluster dynamics and discard a formation scenario where it evolved in quasi-isolation.
#### Prolonged fallback and late-time rebrightening episodes in stellar tidal disruptions as imprints of a galactic environment

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the classical Keplerian framework of existing analytic TDE models by incorporating the gravitational potential of a spherically symmetric galactic mass distribution. We then demonstrate that this broader structure imprints light curve features beyond the predictive scope of traditional models, such as phases of shallower-than-standard decay and late-time rebrightening episodes. Importantly, our framework predicts the occurrence of environment-induced rebrightenings but only on very long timescales, unless the host environment is unrealistically ultra-compact. This means the early evolution of TDEs occurring in typical galaxies is essentially untouched by the host potential, which explains why Keplerian models have been so successful in describing the first few years after disruption. To illustrate, we applied our model to the TDE candidate eRASSt J133157.9-324321 (J1331), the event with the longest reported rebrightening interval, and find that even matching its ${\sim}$30-year rebrightening would demand an implausibly dense host. This demonstrates the limits of environmental effects as an explanation for early rebrightenings reported in the literature. More broadly, our work shows that while the host galaxy leaves TDEs nearly Keplerian at early times, it actively shapes their long-term evolution and can drive departures from the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ decay law. These delayed signals give us a testable way to see how the host galaxy shapes the event, and they may even offer clues about the galaxy's underlying structure.
#### The cosmic web's Lyman-$α$ glow at $z \approx 2.5$; varying hydrodynamic models, dust, and wide-field, narrow-band imaging detection

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse glow of the cosmic web in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission has long been predicted, yet remained elusive to direct wide field detection. We present theoretical calculations that, when compared with recent observations made using the Condor Array Telescope in New Mexico reported in Lanzetta et al. 2024, point to its discovery at $z \approx 2.5$. Synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness maps are constructed from five state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations (Illustris-TNG, SIMBA, EAGLE, CROCODILE, and Sherwood), incorporating dust attenuation, star formation, collisional excitation, and recombination physics. Our cosmic web Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness predictions are consistent with the UV excess detected at high significance in the recent deep, wide field, narrow-band imaging Condor data. The calculations presented here thus demonstrate that diffuse Lyman-$\alpha$ emission is observable with current (and next-generation) wide field low surface brightness facilities, opening the path to direct cartographic mapping of the cosmic web. These findings mark a turning point: for the first time, cosmology moves beyond inference from absorption and high-density peaks, into panoramic imaging of the faint intergalactic scaffolding that underpins structure formation in the Universe.

 Future gamma-ray survey instruments, such as newASTROGAM and AMEGO-X, will significantly improve previous and current all-sky surveys at MeV energies. In this paper we discuss the continuum emission from the Milky Way, two prominent large extended sources, the Fermi bubbles and Loop I, and the extragalactic gamma-ray background. We highlight the importance of measurements in the MeV to GeV energy range for understanding CR production and propagation in the Galaxy, for the determination of the nature of the Fermi bubbles and Loop I, and for exploring the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background.
