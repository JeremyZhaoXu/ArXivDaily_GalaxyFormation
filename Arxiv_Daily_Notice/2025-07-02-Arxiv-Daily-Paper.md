#### Constraining the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster Abell 2142 using MeerKAT L-band polarisation data

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields permeate the Universe, including galaxy clusters, and affect the thermodynamical properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Cosmological simulations predict that seed magnetic fields are amplified up to the $\mu$G-level in the ICM, but the magnetic field strength and structure have been studied in only a few clusters. Abell 2142 is a local massive cluster that shows evidence of a post-merger dynamical state. In this work, we aim to constrain the magnetic field intensity, radial profile and power spectrum within its ICM, providing key insights into the nature of this non-thermal component in galaxy clusters. We present MeerKAT observations of Abell 2142 in the L-band (872-1712 MHz), imaged in polarisation for the first time with this purpose. We derive the Rotation Measure (RM) from the radio galaxies' polarised emission by applying the RM synthesis technique and analyse both the RM and fractional polarisation ($\mathrm{F_p}$). To investigate the magnetic field distribution within the ICM, we compare our results with mock RM maps generated from 3D simulations of the cluster. We find that the RM dispersion, $\sigma_{\mathrm{RM}}$, decreases with projected radius, whereas the $\mathrm{F_p}$ increases. Both trends suggest that the magnetic field intensity decreases at larger distances from the cluster center, in agreement with studies on other clusters. Assuming that the magnetic field energy density scales with the gas thermal energy ($B \propto n_e^{0.5}$), a magnetic field with a power spectrum ranging from scales between 7 and 470 kpc, with peak at $\sim 140$ kpc and mean central strength of $9.5 \pm 1.0 \ \mu$G, provides the best fit to our data. The high central magnetic field lies at the upper end of the range observed in other systems and supports the possibility of an hadronic contribution to the diffuse radio emission previously detected at the cluster center.
#### PyMGal: A Python Package for Generating Optical Mock Observations from Hydrodynamical Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce PyMGal, a Python package for generating optical mock observations of galaxies from hydrodynamical simulations. PyMGal reads the properties of stellar particles from these simulations and generates spectral energy distributions (SEDs) based on a variety of stellar population models that can be customised to fit the user's choice of applications. Given these SEDs, the program can calculate the brightness of particles in different output units for hundreds of unique filters. These quantities can then be projected to a 2D plane mimicking a telescope observation. The software is compatible with different snapshot formats and allows a flexible selection of models, filters, output units, axes of projection, angular resolutions, fields of view, and more. It also supports additional features including dust attenuation, particle smoothing, and the option to output spectral data cubes and maps of mass, age, and metallicity. These synthetic observations can be used to directly compare the simulated objects to reality in order to model galaxy evolution, study different theoretical models, and investigate different observational effects. This package allows the user to perform fast and consistent comparisons between simulation and observation, leading to a better and more precise understanding of what we see in our Universe.
#### Causal Discovery of Latent Variables in Galactic Archaeology

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic archaeology--the study of stellar migration histories--provides insights into galaxy formation and evolution. However, establishing causal relationships between observable stellar properties and their birth conditions remains challenging, as key properties like birth radius are not directly observable. We employ Rank-based Latent Causal Discovery (RLCD) to uncover the causal structure governing the chemodynamics of a simulated Milky Way galaxy. Using only five observable properties (metallicity, age, and orbital parameters), we recover in a purely data-driven manner a causal graph containing two latent nodes that correspond to real physical properties: the birth radius and guiding radius of stars. Our study demonstrates the potential of causal discovery models in astrophysics.
#### DeepCHART: Mapping the 3D dark matter density field from Ly$α$ forest surveys using deep learning

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00135

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00135

 - **Abstract**
 We present DeepCHART (Deep learning for Cosmological Heterogeneity and Astrophysical Reconstruction via Tomography), a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct the three-dimensional dark matter density field at redshift $z=2.5$ from Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra. Leveraging a 3D variational autoencoder with a U-Net architecture, DeepCHART performs fast, likelihood-free inference, accurately capturing the non-linear gravitational dynamics and baryonic processes embedded in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. When applied to joint datasets combining Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption and coeval galaxy positions, the reconstruction quality improves further. For current surveys, such as Subaru/PFS, CLAMATO, and LATIS, with an average transverse sightline spacing of $d_\perp=2.4h^{-1}$cMpc, DeepCHART achieves high-fidelity reconstructions over the density range $0.4<\Delta_{\rm DM}<15$, with a voxel-wise Pearson correlation coefficient of $\rho\simeq 0.77$. These reconstructions are obtained using Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra with signal-to-noise ratios as low as 2 and instrumental resolution $R=2500$, matching Subaru/PFS specifications. For future high-density surveys enabled by instruments such as ELT/MOSAIC and WST/IFS with $d_\perp\simeq 1h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$, the correlation improves to $\rho\simeq 0.90$ across a wider dynamic range ($0.25<\Delta_{\rm DM}<40$). The framework reliably recovers the dark matter density PDF as well as the power spectrum, with only mild suppression at intermediate scales. In terms of cosmic web classification, DeepCHART successfully identifies 81% of voids, 75% of sheets, 63% of filaments, and 43% of nodes. We propose DeepCHART as a powerful and scalable framework for field-level cosmological inference, readily generalisable to other observables, and offering a robust, efficient means of maximising the scientific return of upcoming spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive disks are outstanding galaxies whose formation and evolution are still poorly understood. They comprise a large variety of objects, ranging from large, low-surface-brightness galaxies, such as Malin 1, to the most spectacular superluminous spirals. However, we still do not know the physical mechanisms behind its formation, and whether they will be long-lived objects or whether their mass could destroy them in time. We aim to investigate the formation and evolution of these galaxies using the magnetohydrodynamical state-of-the-art simulation IllustrisTNG-100. We defined supermassive disks as galaxies with $\lambda / \sqrt{\varepsilon} \geq 0.31$ or 0.71, and with stellar mass log$_{10}M_\star/M_\odot > 10^{11}$. We studied the color, merging history, AGN history, and environment in which these galaxies reside. Supermassive disk galaxies typically experience a quiescent merging history, with $48\%$ experiencing no significant mergers at $z \leq 1$. Their stellar mass growth is driven mainly by star formation, unlike spheroidal galaxies, which require a significant number of mergers to form. Moreover, the mergers experienced by disk galaxies are generally rich in gas content, irrespective of whether they are minor or major events. Supermassive disks exist across various environments, from isolation to clusters, with $\sim 60\%$ inhabiting in isolation or low-mass groups, $\sim 25\%$ residing in massive groups, and $\sim15\%$ residing within galaxy clusters. When studying the evolution of supermassive disks selected at $z=0.5$, we show that when they gain sufficient mass, the probability of them maintaining their disk-like structure up to $z=0$ is relatively high ($\sim 60\%$). Lastly, while AGN significantly influences the regulation of star formation in galaxies, it does not directly alter their morphological structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Hypervelocity stars are unique objects moving through the Milky Way at speeds exceeding the local escape velocity, providing valuable insights into the Galactic gravitational potential and the properties of its central supermassive black hole. The advent of Gaia DR3 offers an unprecedented astrometric precision, enabling the discovery of new hypervelocity stars and facilitating their characterization. This study seeks to identify and characterize hypervelocity star candidates using Gaia DR3 data, focusing on stars lacking radial velocity measurements. Our goal was to estimate the total velocities of these stars and establish their origin within the Galactic framework, if possible. We applied strict selection criteria to Gaia DR3 data, focusing on sources with low parallax uncertainties and high astrometric fidelity. The distributions of the total velocities in the Galactic rest frame were derived and used to identify candidates. Spectroscopic follow-up with VLT/FORS2 provided radial velocity measurements for a subset of these candidates. We evaluated the probabilities of stars exceeding local escape velocities under different Galactic potential models and traced their past orbits to identify possible origins. From Gaia DR3, we identified 149 hypervelocity star candidates with Pesc > 50% of exceeding local escape velocities. Our follow-up spectroscopy for 23 of those sources confirms that the selected targets are traveling at high velocities, with many appearing to escape the Galaxy, depending on the Galactic potential adopted. Our analysis suggests that nearly one-third of the stars may have an extra-Galactic origin. These findings highlight the need for more precise astrometric and spectroscopic data to conclusively determine the origins of hypervelocity stars and improve models of the Galactic potential.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of an SX Phoenicis-type pulsating variable star via 217 epochs of time-series photometry from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1. The star, designated LSST-DP1-O- 614435753623041404 (or LSST-C25_var1 for short), has mean magnitudes of $(\langle g\rangle, \langle r\rangle) = (18.65, 18.63)$, with pulsation amplitudes of (0.60, 0.38)~mag in these bands. Its period is 0.0767 days (1.841 hours), typical of SX Phe pulsators. We derive a distance to the star of 16.6 kpc based on an SX Phe period-luminosity relation. Its position $\sim5$ kpc from the Galactic plane, in the outer Milky Way disk at a Galactocentric distance of $\sim22$ kpc, and its proper motion suggest that LSST-C25_var1 is part of the Monoceros Ring structure. This star is presented as a small taste of the many thousands of variable stars expected in Rubin/LSST data.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00293

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the impact of repulsive self-interactions of moderate strength on fuzzy dark matter halos focusing on the core and granule size, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton. Our analysis extends across the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the gravitationally bound solitonic core. Within this examined range of self-coupling strengths, we find that mergers with a given initial spatial configuration and an increasing self-interaction strength $g$, result in cores with increased size that exhibit a reduced central density and oscillate with decreased frequency. All of these features are in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. The characteristic size of the granules in the surrounding halo also grows but by a much smaller amount relative to the core; accordingly, typical inter-vortex distances are also only mildly affected. We also measure the total length of the vortex network which, although less robust, shows no clear dependence on increasing $g$ and no signs of decay over the timescales of our simulations. Measures of coherence of the field behave as in the non-interacting case, again clearly separating the coherent core form the quasi-coherent halo. Interestingly, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing self-coupling strength, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.
#### Dark from light (DfL): Inferring halo properties from luminous tracers with machine learning trained on cosmological simulations. I. Method, proof of concept & preliminary testing

 - **Abstract**
 We present Dark from Light (DfL) - a novel method to infer the dark sector in wide-field galaxy surveys, leveraging a machine learning approach trained on contemporary cosmological simulations. The aim of this algorithm is to provide a fast, straightforward, and accurate route to estimating dark matter halo masses and group membership in wide-field spectroscopic galaxy surveys. This approach requires a highly limited number of input parameters and yields full probability distribution functions for the output halo masses. To achieve this, we train a series of Random Forest (RF) regression models on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations at z=0-3, which provide model-dependent mappings from luminous tracers to dark matter halo properties. We incorporate the individual regression models into a virial group-finding algorithm (DfL), which outputs halo properties for observational-like input data. We test the method at z=0-2 for both the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG models, as well as in a cross-validation mode. We demonstrate that known halo masses can be recovered with a mean systematic bias of $\langle b \rangle = \pm 0.10\,$dex (resulting from simulation choice), a mean statistical uncertainty of $\langle \sigma \rangle = 0.12 \,$dex across epochs, and a central - (core) satellite classification accuracy of 96%. We establish that this approach yields superior halo mass recovery to standard abundance matching applied to groups identified through a friends-of-friends algorithm. Additionally, we compare the outputs of DfL to observational constraints on the $M_* - M_{\rm Halo}$ relation from strong gravitational lensing at $z \sim 0$, demonstrating the promise of this novel approach. Finally, we systematically quantify how DfL performs on observational-like input data with varying stellar mass uncertainty and spectroscopic incompleteness, enabling robust error calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 The simulation cost for cosmological simulation-based inference can be decreased by combining simulation sets of varying fidelity. We propose an approach to such multi-fidelity inference based on feature matching and knowledge distillation.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00770

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates using five years of microlensing data from the OGLE survey. While the majority of OGLE's $\sim 2000$ microlensing events are well-explained by stellar populations such as brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and compact remnants, a subset of six ultrashort-timescale events ($t_E \sim 0.1 - 0.3$ days) may signal the presence of PBHs. Building upon prior work that adopted the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profile, we examine how alternative DM halo models -- specifically the Einasto and Burkert profiles -- affect microlensing predictions and the constraints on PBH abundance. We computed differential microlensing event rates for both profiles, using the main-sequence star rate as an observational benchmark. Our results show that neither the Einasto nor Burkert profiles reproduce the distribution of main-sequence star events, yet both allow for viable explanations of the ultrashort-timescale events with PBH masses $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Using a Poisson likelihood analysis under the null hypothesis that no PBH is observed in OGLE dataset, we derive 95\% C.L. upper bounds on $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$, finding that the constraints are significantly relaxed under the Einasto and Burkert profiles compared to the NFW case. These results underscore the sensitivity of PBH constraints to the assumed DM halo structure and highlight the importance of accurately modeling the inner Galactic density profile to robustly assess PBH dark matter scenarios.
#### A period-increasing oscillation signal in a long gamma-ray burst

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the brightest electromagnetic bursts in the universe, are believed to originate from ultra-relativistic jets launched by the rapidly rotating central engine, either a disk-surrounded newly formed black hole (BH) or a magnetar. Such a central engine potentially possesses rapidly evolving physical characteristics, as it is just born. The caught of time-increasing frequency in the gravitational wave signals is the evidence of upon opinion. Here we report a possible oscillatory signal identified in GRB 131122B with periods increasing from 1.27 seconds to 4.02 seconds in a time interval of 16.75 seconds. Such a peculiar oscillation signal has not been identified in GRBs before and its periodic evolution could also be the quickest one found in the electromagnetic radiation window of astrophysics. The precession of a misaligned accretion disk caused by the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass BH may be responsible for this signal. This finding could open a new window to reveal the nature of the hiding central engine of GRBs.
#### A binary origin of ultra-long period radio pulsars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00946

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a possible binary evolution model for the formation of ultra-long period pulsars (ULPPs). The model involves two key stages: first, a neutron star (NS) in wide binaries undergoes an effective spin-down phase through wind-fed accretion from its massive stellar companion; second, the supernova explosion of the companion leads to the disruption of the binary system, and produces two isolated compact stars. One of the them is the first-born, slowly rotating NSs, and our binary and spin evolution calculations show that the spin periods range from $\lesssim 0.1$ s to $\gtrsim 10^8$ s. This offers a possible formation channel for some of the long-period radio transients. We estimate that the formation rate of such systems in the Milky Way is approximately about $10^{-6}$ $\rm yr^{-1}$.
