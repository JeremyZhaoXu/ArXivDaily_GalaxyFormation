 - **Abstract**
 The "Reduced Speed of Light" (RSL) approximation is commonly used to speed up radiative transfer calculations in cosmological simulations. However, it has been shown previously that the RSL approximation leads to photon non-conservation in some regimes. I show that these missing photons can be counted exactly for some numerical schemes. Adding them back into a simulation, however, is a much harder task. I show one example of such a scheme, which achieves sub-percent accuracy on simple tests. Unfortunately, the scheme performs much worse on semi-realistic simulations of cosmic reionization, leading to a faster overlap and significant errors in the point-to-point comparison of the RSL radiation field with the reference simulation that maintains the full speed of light for the radiative transfer.
#### The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Satellite Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the properties of satellite galaxies around 1,024 Milky Way-mass hosts from the DREAMS Project, simulated within a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Utilizing the TNG galaxy-formation model, the DREAMS simulations incorporate both baryonic physics and cosmological uncertainties for a large sample of galaxies with diverse environments and formation histories. We investigate the relative impact of the physical uncertainty from the galaxy-formation model on predicted satellite properties using four metrics: the satellite stellar mass function, radial distribution, inner slope of dark matter density profile, and stellar half-light radius. We compare these predictions to observations from the SAGA Survey and the DREAMS N-body simulations and find that uncertainties from baryonic physics modeling are subdominant to the scatter arising from halo-to-halo variance. Where baryonic modeling does affect satellites, the supernova wind energy has the largest effect on the satellite properties that we investigate. Specifically, increased supernova wind energy suppresses the stellar mass of satellites and results in more extended stellar half-light radii. The adopted wind speed has only a minor impact, and other astrophysical and cosmological parameters show no measurable effect. Our findings highlight the robustness of satellite properties against uncertainties in baryonic physics modeling.
#### Determining the Milky Way gravitational potential without selection functions

 - **Abstract**
 Selection effects, such as interstellar extinction and varying survey depth, complicate efforts to determine the gravitational potential - and thus the distribution of baryonic and dark matter - throughout the Milky Way galaxy using stellar kinematics. We present a new variant of the "Deep Potential" method of determining the gravitational potential from a snapshot of stellar positions and velocities that does not require any modeling of spatial selection functions. Instead of modeling the full six-dimensional phase-space distribution function $f\left(\vec{x},\vec{v}\right)$ of observed kinematic tracers, we model the conditional velocity distribution $p\left(\vec{v}\mid\vec{x}\right)$, which is unaffected by a purely spatial selection function. We simultaneously learn the gravitational potential $\Phi\left(\vec{x}\right)$ and the underlying spatial density of the entire tracer population $n\left(\vec{x}\right)$ - including unobserved stars - using the collisionless Boltzmann equation under the stationarity assumption. The advantage of this method is that unlike the spatial selection function, all of the quantities we model, $p\left(\vec{v}\mid\vec{x}\right)$, $\Phi\left(\vec{x}\right)$, and $n\left(\vec{x}\right)$, typically vary smoothly in both position and velocity. We demonstrate that this "conditional" Deep Potential method is able to accurately recover the gravitational potential in a mock dataset with a complex three-dimensional dust distribution that imprints fine angular structure on the selection function. Because we do not need to model the spatial selection function, our new method can effectively scale to large, complex datasets while using relatively few parameters, and is thus well suited to Gaia data.
#### Hidden in Plain Sight II: Characterizing the luminous companion to Kappa Velorum with VLTI/GRAVITY
 - **Authors:** D. M. Rowan, S. Kraus, Todd A. Thompson
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02116

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02116

 - **Abstract**
 Kappa Velorum (Markeb, HD 81188) is one of the brightest stars in the Southern sky and has long been known to be a single-lined spectroscopic binary. The binary mass function is large, $f(M)=1.15\ M_\odot$, suggesting that the bright (V=2.5) B2IV star may host a dark, compact object companion. We use VLTI GRAVITY observations to definitively test this possibility by directly resolving the binary. We detect a main sequence B star companion and rule out the compact object scenario. By combining the relative astrometric orbit and archival radial velocities, we report an updated precise characterization of the orbit (period $P=116.795\pm0.002$ d, eccentricity $e=0.1764\pm0.0004$, inclination $i=74.04\pm0.01^{\circ}$) and estimate the masses of the B stars. Using the original Hipparcos parallax measurement $\varpi = 6.05\pm0.48$ mas, we find $M_1 = 10^{+4}_{-2}\ M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 6.9\pm1.0\ M_\odot$. The uncertainties on the masses are primarily driven by the uncertain parallax, which we find is likely biased by the orbital motion. We use an archival UVES spectrum and MIST evolutionary tracks to refine our mass estimates. Finally, we discuss how interferometry and high-contrast imaging may be used to characterize other candidate star+compact object binaries, including those that will be discovered with Gaia DR4, as part of a larger effort to uncover the hidden population of black holes in the Milky Way.
#### Ripples in the baryon to dark matter ratio in $Λ$CDM: implications for galaxy formation

 - **Abstract**
 We use the FLAMINGO galaxy formation model to quantify the impact of baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations on galaxy formation in $\Lambda$CDM. In linear theory, these perturbations represent local, compensated variations in the ratio between the baryon and CDM densities; they freeze in amplitude at late times, with an RMS amplitude of $1.5\%$ on the Lagrangian scale of a $10^{11}\,\rm M_\odot$ halo ($0.85\, \rm{Mpc}$). Although such perturbations arise naturally within $\Lambda$CDM, most cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models to date omit them. These perturbations are strongly anti-correlated with the matter overdensity field such that halos form with baryon fractions below the cosmic mean, with earlier-collapsing halos exhibiting stronger baryonic suppression. To isolate the galaxy response, we analyse three hydrodynamical simulations with identical initial matter overdensity fields that: i) include isocurvature modes, ii) omit them, or iii) invert their amplitude. At $z=8$, isocurvature perturbations reduce the mean baryon fraction and star formation rates of resolved halos by $ 5\%$ and $ 12\%$, respectively, relative to the null-isocurvature case. These effects are almost independent of halo mass and diminish steadily with time, reaching $ 0.1\%$ and $ 1\%$ by $z=0$. We develop a model based on spherical collapse that accurately reproduces the mean baryon fraction suppression. As high-redshift observations become increasingly routine, incorporating isocurvature perturbations into simulations and semi-analytic models will be important for robust predictions of early galaxy and black hole formation in the JWST era.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have long been hypothesized as valuable indicators of black holes, offering insight into their demographics and behaviour out to high redshift. TDEs have also enabled the discovery of a few Massive Black Holes (MBHs) with inferred masses of $10^4$--$10^6\,M_\odot$, often associated with the nuclei of dwarf galaxies or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). Here we present AT2022zod, an extreme and short-lived optical flare in an elliptical galaxy at z=0.11, residing within 3kpc of the galaxy's centre. Its luminosity and ~30-day duration make it unlikely to have originated from the host galaxy's central supermassive black hole (SMBH), which estimate to have a mass around $10^8\,M_\odot$. Assuming that the emission mechanism is consistent with known observed TDEs, we find that such a rapidly evolving transient could either be produced by a MBH in the intermediate-mass range or, alternatively, result from the tidal disruption of a star on a non-parabolic orbit around the central SMBH. We suggest that the most plausible origin for AT2022zod is the tidal disruption of a star by a MBH embedded in a UCD. As the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time comes online, we propose that AT2022zod serves as an important event for refining search strategies and characterization techniques for intermediate-mass black holes.
#### Inefficient Circularization, Delayed Stream-Disk Interaction and Reprocessing: A Five-Stage Model for the Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Tidal Disruption Event EP240222a

 - **Abstract**
 EP240222a is the first intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) tidal disruption event (TDE) captured in real-time with multi-wavelength observations and spectroscopic confirmation. However, its light curves deviate substantially from previous theoretical expectations. Motivated by these unique features, we have developed a novel model that successfully reproduces its peculiar evolution. Our model delineates five stages: (1) Initial Stage of inefficient circularization; (2) Slow-Rising Stage with a faint X-ray precursor disk fed by successive self-crossings; (3) Fast-Rising Stage, where delayed stream-disk interaction at momentum flux matching drives a sharp luminosity rise; (4) Plateau Stage with super-Eddington accretion, outflow, reprocessing, and a clear polar line-of-sight; and (5) Decline Stage of sub-Eddington accretion and ongoing reprocessing. Our fit indicates the disruption of a $M_* \approx 0.4~M_\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star with a penetration factor $\beta \approx 1.0$. Our model, which incorporates key TDE processes, establishes EP240222a-like light curves as typical IMBH-TDE signatures. The distinctive identifier is a slow rise in X-rays and a corresponding slow rise/quasi-plateau in the UV/optical, followed by a brighter, super-Eddington plateau in both bands, though other forms exist, such as the rapid rise from white dwarf (WD) disruptions over minutes to days.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a spectroscopic campaign around the diffuse dwarf galaxy Crater 2 (Cra2) and its tidal tails as part of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($S^5$). Cra2 is a Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite with extremely cold kinematics, but a huge size similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud, which may be difficult to explain within collisionless cold dark matter. We identify 143 Cra2 members, of which 114 belong to the galaxy's main body and 29 are deemed part of its stellar stream. We confirm that Cra2 is dynamically cold (central velocity dispersion $2.51^{+0.33}_{-0.30}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) and also discover a $\approx$7$\sigma$ velocity gradient consistent with its tidal debris track. We separately estimate the stream velocity dispersion to be $5.74^{+0.98}_{-0.83}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. We develop a suite of $N$-body simulations with both cuspy and cored density profiles on a realistic Cra2 orbit to compare with $S^5$ observations. We find that the velocity dispersion ratio between Cra2 stream and galaxy ($2.30^{+0.41}_{-0.35}$) is difficult to reconcile with a cuspy halo with fiducial concentration and an initial mass predicted by standard stellar mass$-$halo mass relationships. Instead, either a cored halo with relatively small core radius or a low-concentration cuspy model can reproduce this ratio. Despite tidal mass loss, Cra2 is metal-poor ($\langle \rm[Fe/H]\rangle=-2.16\pm0.04$) compared to the stellar mass$-$metallicity relation for its luminosity. Other diffuse dwarf galaxies similar to Cra2 in the Local Group (Antlia 2 and Andromeda 19) also challenge galaxy formation models. Finally, we discuss possible formation scenarios for Cra2, including ram-pressure stripping of a gas-rich progenitor combined with tides.
#### The suppression of the matter power spectrum: strong feedback from X-ray gas mass fractions, kSZ effect profiles, and galaxy-galaxy lensing

 - **Abstract**
 Baryon feedback redistributes gas relative to the underlying dark matter distribution and suppresses the matter power spectrum on small scales, but the amplitude and scale dependence of this effect are uncertain. We constrain the impact of baryon feedback on the matter power spectrum by jointly analysing X-ray gas mass fractions from the eROSITA and HSC-XXL samples and SDSS/DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles; the samples are characterised with galaxy-galaxy lensing and together span group and cluster masses at $0<z<1$. Using the baryonification framework, our joint eROSITA and kSZ model gives precise constraints on the suppression of the matter power spectrum: $10 \pm 2\%$ at $k=1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The inferred gas profiles are more extended and the power suppression is stronger than predicted by the fiducial models of recent hydrodynamical simulation suites, including FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS. The HSC-XXL gas mass fractions, which the fiducial simulations were calibrated to reproduce, prefer more moderate power suppression than the kSZ and eROSITA data: $5 \pm 4\%$ at $k=1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. With a simulated LSST Year 1 weak lensing analysis, we demonstrate a framework for next-generation surveys: calibrating feedback models with multi-wavelength gas observables to recover the small-scale statistical power of cosmic shear.
#### A new constraint on the $y$-distortion with FIRAS: implications for feedback models in galaxy formation and cosmic shear measurements

 - **Abstract**
 The $y$-type distortion of the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation probes the pressure of the gas trapped in galaxy groups and clusters. We reanalyze archival data of the FIRAS instrument with an improved astrophysical foreground cleaning technique, and measure a mean $y$-distortion of $\langle y\rangle = (1.2\pm 2.0) \times 10^{-6}$ ($\langle y\rangle\lesssim 5.2\times 10^{-6}$ at 95\% C.L.), a factor of $\sim 3$ tighter than the original FIRAS results. This measurement directly rules out many models of baryonic feedback as implemented in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, mostly using information in objects with mass $M\lesssim 10^{14} {\rm M}_{\odot}$. We discuss its implications for the analysis of cosmic shear and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect data, and future spectral distortion experiments.
