#### Compact groups of galaxies in the TNG100 simulation

 - **Abstract**
 Using the TNG100 cosmological simulation, we study the formation and evolution of compact groups of galaxies. Over a redshift range of $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.2$, we identify these compact groups as FoF galaxy groups with high mean surface brightness ($\overline{\mu}_r < 26.33 ~ \mathrm{mag~arcsec^{-2}}$) and a minimum of 4 galaxy members. Typically, our compact groups have a median characteristic size of $\sim$$150$ kpc, 1D velocity dispersions of $150 ~ {\rm km ~ s^{-1}}$, and stellar masses around $2\times 10^{11} ~ M_{\odot}$. Roughly 1\% of galaxies of stellar mass above $10^9 ~ M_{\odot}$ lie in physically dense compact groups. We found that these systems do not constitute a separate category within the broader population of galaxy groups; instead, they represent the lower end of the size distribution in the sequence of galaxy group sizes. We traced their evolution backward in time, revealing that they initially form as galaxies systems with a mean low surface brightness that systematically increases to a peak value before stabilizing over time, exhibiting oscillatory behaviour over the following several Gyrs during which mergers may occur. Mergers often transform compact groups with typically four members into galaxy pairs or triplets, which may eventually can increase again their number of members accreting a new galaxy. Nevertheless, the full merging of all constituent galaxies into a single massive galaxy is a rare phenomenon.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar mass is the most fundamental property of a galaxy. While it has been robustly measured for millions of external galaxies, it remains poorly constrained for the Milky Way because of the strong selection effect from our inside perspective. In this work, we reconstruct the intrinsic vertical mass density profile in the solar neighborhood and the radial mass density profile across the entire Galaxy using data from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys, following careful correction for the selection function. The local density profile exhibits strong north-south asymmetry in the geometric thick disk regime and increases steeply toward the disk mid-plane, favoring an exponential model over the sech$^2$ model. Integrating the local vertical density profile yields a surface stellar mass density of 31.563$\pm$2.813(syst.)$\pm$0.024(stoch.)~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$, of which 25.074 and 6.489~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$ correspond to living stars and stellar remnants, respectively. The radial surface mass density profile {of the Milky Way} shares the same flat inner component as observed in the brightness profile. With this mass density profile {and local mass density from Gaia}, we derive a new estimate of the total stellar mass of the Milky Way of 2.607$\pm$0.353(syst.)$\pm$0.085(stoch.)${\rm \times10^{10}M_{\odot}}$, a factor of two lower than the previous results. This discrepancy arises primarily from the inner disk profile, which was previously unavailable and extrapolated from the outer disk profile. The lower stellar mass estimate of the Milky Way significantly reduces its rarity in terms of supermassive black hole mass among external galaxies and implies a larger dark matter-to-baryon mass ratio in the inner Galaxy.
#### The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial redshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.
#### Binary stars in the Milky Way nuclear stellar cluster

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass galaxies, including the Milky Way, typically host both a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a nuclear stellar cluster (NSC). Binaries in an NSC evolve via close encounters with surrounding stars and secular processes related to the SMBH. We study moderately soft and hard binaries ($0.03$-$2.5\,\mathrm{au}$, $M \lesssim 2\,M_\odot$) initially at galactocentric radii 0.1 and 0.3 pc using three-body simulations including von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations and tidal dissipation over $\sim 10$ Gyr. Binaries migrate both inward and outward as a consequence of kicks received in the three-body encounters. Inward migration leads to destruction via mergers and evaporation, while outward migration is a pathway to retaining intact binaries for $\gtrsim 10$ Gyr. All surviving binaries are hard and circular, but outcomes for binaries initially at the hard-soft boundary are stochastic. We find that: (i) about $0.3$ percent of evaporated binaries fall into the SMBH's loss cone, (ii) at least $1$ percent of mergers occur late enough to appear as blue straggler stars (BSSs) on the main sequence or as recently evolved red giants, (iii) about $1$ percent of binaries initially at 0.1 pc merge within the inner arcsec of the NSC, and (iv) less than about $80$ percent of field-star collisions with a binary star lead to a subsequent merger; a three-body pile up, which are relatively common in the first 1-2 Gyr and could serve as a way to form more massive BSSs in the NSC. We predict that a small fraction of binaries originate closer to the SMBH than their present-day orbits, and vice versa for evaporated binaries and BSSs. The mergers confined to the inner arcsec occur after $\gtrsim 300$ Myr, too long to be directly related to the formation of the S-stars or G-objects, but suggest that the inner arcsec is contaminated with BSSs from earlier star formation events.
