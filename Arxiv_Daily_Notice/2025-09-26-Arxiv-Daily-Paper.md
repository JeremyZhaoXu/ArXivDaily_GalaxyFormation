 - **Abstract**
 We present the most precise and lowest-mass weak lensing measurements of dwarf galaxies to date, enabled by spectroscopic lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and photometric lenses from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) calibrated with DESI redshifts. Using DESI spectroscopy from the first data release, we construct clean samples of galaxies with median stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.3-10.1$ and measure their weak lensing signals with sources from DES, KiDS, and SDSS, achieving detections with $S/N$ up to 14 for dwarf galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})<$9.25) -- opening up a new regime for lensing measurements of low-mass systems. Leveraging DES photometry calibrated with DESI, we extend to a photometric dwarf sample of over 700,000 galaxies, enabling robust lensing detections of dwarf galaxies with combined $S/N=38$ and a significant measurement down to $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.0$. We show that the one-halo regime (scales $\lesssim 0.15h^{-1}\rm Mpc$) is insensitive to various systematic and sample selection effects, providing robust halo mass estimates, while the signal in the two-halo regime depends on galaxy color and environment. These results demonstrate that DESI already enables precise dwarf lensing measurements, and that calibrated photometric samples extend this capability. Together, they pave the way for novel constraints on dwarf galaxy formation and dark matter physics with upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent efforts have extended our view of the number and properties of satellite galaxies beyond the Local Group firmly down to $\rm M_\star\sim 10^6 M_\odot$. A similarly complete view of the field dwarf population has lagged behind. Using the background galaxies sample from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey at $z<0.05$, we take inventory of the dwarf population down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$ using three metrics: the stellar mass function (SMF) as function of environment, the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) of dwarf galaxies inferred via abundance matching, and the quenched fraction of highly isolated dwarfs. We find that the low-mass SMF shape shows minimal environmental dependence, with the field dwarf SMF described by a low-mass power-law index of $\alpha_1=-1.44\pm0.09$ down to $\rm M_\star \sim 5\times10^6 M_\odot$, and that the quenched fraction of isolated dwarfs drops monotonically to $f_{q} \sim 10^{-3}$ at $\rm M_\star \sim \rm 10^{8.5} M_\odot$. Though slightly steeper than estimates from \HI{} kinematic measures, our inferred SHMR agrees with literature measurements of satellite systems, consistent with minimal environmental dependence of the SHMR in the probed mass range. Finally, although most contemporary cosmological simulations against which we compare accurately predict the \sagalocal{} SHMR, we find that big-box cosmological simulations largely over-predict isolated galaxy quenched fractions via a turnaround in $f_q(\rm M_\star)$ at $\rm 10^8\lesssim M_\star/M_\odot\lesssim 10^9$, underscoring the complexities in disentangling the drivers of galaxy formation and the need for systematic multidimensional observations of the dwarf population across environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection of weak gravitational lensing around spectroscopically confirmed dwarf galaxies, using the large overlap between DESI DR1 spectroscopic data and DECADE/DES weak lensing catalogs. A clean dwarf galaxy sample with well-defined redshift and stellar mass cuts enables excess surface mass density measurements in two stellar mass bins ($\log \rm{M}_*=[8.2, 9.2]~M_\odot$ and $\log \rm{M}_*=[9.2, 10.2]~M_\odot$), with signal-to-noise ratios of $5.6$ and $12.4$ respectively. This signal-to-noise drops to $4.5$ and $9.2$ respectively for measurements without applying individual inverse probability (IIP) weights, which mitigates fiber incompleteness from DESI's targeting. The measurements are robust against variations in stellar mass estimates, photometric shredding, and lensing calibration systematics. Using a simulation-based modeling framework with stellar mass function priors, we constrain the stellar mass-halo mass relation and find a satellite fraction of $\simeq 0.3$, which is higher than previous photometric studies but $1.5\sigma$ lower than $\Lambda$CDM predictions. We find that IIP weights have a significant impact on lensing measurements and can change the inferred $f_{\rm{sat}}$ by a factor of two, highlighting the need for accurate fiber incompleteness corrections for dwarf galaxy samples. Our results open a new observational window into the galaxy-halo connection at low masses, showing that future massively multiplexed spectroscopic observations and weak lensing data will enable stringent tests of galaxy formation models and $\Lambda$CDM predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a physically interpretable framework to quantify dynamical disturbances in galaxy clusters using projected two-dimensional phase-space information. Based on the TNG-Cluster simulation, we construct a disturbance score that captures merger-driven asymmetries through features such as velocity dispersion and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) peak fitting, which captures asymmetries indicative of dynamical disturbance. All features are derived from observable quantities and are intended to be measurable in future surveys. To enable observational application, we adopt a simplified estimator using aperture mass map statistics as a mass ratio proxy in TNG300-1, and validate its performance with weak lensing data from The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). While phase-space diagnostics reveal merger-driven asymmetries, they are not sensitive to whether the secondary progenitor is infalling or receding, and thus cannot distinguish future mergers from past mergers. To address this, we incorporate the star formation rate (SFR) from TNG-Cluster and propose the blue galaxy fraction as a promising observational tracer of merger timing. Finally, we construct mock Chandra X-ray images of TNG-Cluster halos at redshift $z=0.2$, and find that the offset between the X-ray peak and the position of the most massive black hole (used as a proxy for the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, BCG) correlates with our disturbance score, serving as a consistency check. We also perform case studies using LoVoCCS observational data, correlating the blue galaxy fraction with disturbance scores derived from the eROSITA morphology catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 Generally, merger likelihood increases in denser environments; however, the large relative velocities at the centres of dense clusters are expected to reduce the likelihood of mergers for satellite galaxies. Tidal features probe the recent merger histories of galaxies. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce an unprecedented sample of tidal features around millions of galaxies. We use LSST-like mock observations of galaxies at $z\sim0$ from the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG and Magneticum Pathfinder cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations to predict the occurrence rates of tidal features around satellite galaxies across group and cluster environments in the velocity-radius projected phase-space diagram to investigate the impact of these environments on tidal feature occurrence. We find that ancient infallers in the projected phase-space exhibit a decreasing tidal feature fraction with increasing halo mass, whereas recent infallers in the projected phase-space show unchanging tidal feature fractions with halo mass. Our results show, for the first time in cosmological simulations, a suppression of tidal feature fractions in the central regions of galaxy clusters, indicating a reduced merger rate due to higher cluster-centric velocities and lower galaxy total masses in the cluster centres. Using a toy model, we show that the presence of more tidal features in the recent infaller zone and cluster outskirts suggests that tidal features occur in interactions within infalling groups and dissipate by the time they are ancient infallers, indicating a $\lesssim3\pm2$ Gyr survival time of tidal features within clusters.
#### Galactic Contrail in NGC 3627 caused by Dwarf Galaxy Candidate or Massive Black Hole Flyby

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a kpc scale molecular contrail in the spiral galaxy NGC 3627, a narrow structure spanning 8 kpc in length with a width of 200 pc and an extreme aspect ratio of 40, observed in both mid-infrared dust emission (PHANGS-JWST) and CO(2-1) gas (PHANGS-ALMA). This contrail size significantly exceeds the size of any known analogs in the Milky Way and exhibits supersonic turbulence (10 km/s). Its morphology and dynamics are consistent with gravitational focusing by a flyby compact object of mass 1e6 M_sun, likely a massive black hole or a dwarf galaxy nucleus, traversing the disk at >300 km/s. The crossing time of such a contrail, estimated from its width and velocity dispersion, is only $\sim 20$ Myr, implying a recent interaction. This contrail can be caused by a dwarf galaxy, or massive black hole nucleus. This discovery establishes galactic-scale contrails as probes of massive dark objects interacting with medium in and around galactic disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic simulations can connect outflow observables to the physical conditions of outflowing gas. Here, we use simulations of isolated disk galaxies ranging from dwarf mass ($M_{200} = 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) to Milky Way mass ($M_{200} = 10^{12}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), based on the FIRE-2 subgrid models to investigate multiphase galactic outflows. We use the CHIMES non-equilibrium chemistry module to create synthetic spectra of common outflow tracers ([CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$, $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, H$\alpha$ and $[\mathrm{OIII}]_{5007\text{A}}$). Using our synthetic spectra we measure the mass outflow rate, kinetic power and momentum flux using observational techniques. In [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ we measure outflow rates of $10^{-4}$ to $1$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ across an SFR range of $10^{-3}$ to $1$ $\text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is in reasonable agreement with observations. The significant discrepancy is in $\mathrm{CO}_{J(1-0)}$, with the simulations lying $\approx1$ dex below the observational sample. We test observational assumptions used to derive outflow properties from synthetic spectra. We find the greatest uncertainty lies in measurements of electron density, as estimates using the SII doublet can overestimate the actual electron density by up to 2 dex, which changes mass outflow rates by up to 4 dex. We also find that molecular outflows are especially sensitive to the conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2 mass, with outflow rates changing by up to 4 dex in our least massive galaxy. Comparing the outflow properties derived from the synthetic spectra to those derived directly from the simulation, we find that [CII]$_{158\rm{\mu m}}$ probes outflows at greater distances from the disk, whilst we find that molecular gas does not survive at large distances within outflows within our modestly star-forming disk galaxies simulated in this work.

 - **Abstract**
 AT2018cqh is a unique optical tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in a dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact radio emission, unresolved at a scale of <~ 0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high brightness temperature of $T_b$ ~> 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.
