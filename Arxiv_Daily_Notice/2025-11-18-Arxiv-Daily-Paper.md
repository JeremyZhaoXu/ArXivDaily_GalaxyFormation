 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse outskirts of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) encode valuable information about the assembly history and mass of their host dark matter halos. However, the low surface brightness of these stellar halos has historically made them difficult to observe. Recent deep imaging, particularly with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), has shown that the stellar mass within relatively large projected annuli, such as within $50$ and $100$ kpc, is a promising proxy for halo mass. However, the optimal radial definition of this "outskirt mass" remains uncertain. We construct an HSC-like mock observing pipeline to measure the stellar mass density profiles of BCGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations. Our mock observations closely reproduce HSC profiles across six orders of magnitude in surface density. We then systematically measure stellar masses within different annuli and how tightly they are connected to halo mass. We find that stellar masses measured within simple apertures exhibit considerably more scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass relation than those measured within projected ellipsoidal annuli. We identify an optimal range of definitions, with inner radii between $\sim 70$-$200$ kpc and outer radii between $\sim 125$-$500$ kpc. We also introduce two halo-mass-dependent Sérsic models for the average stellar halo profiles. We present a Sérsic-based fitting function that describes the profiles as a function of the halo mass, $M_{\rm vir}$, with a median error of $54\%$. Adding the central stellar mass of the BCG as a second parameter slightly improves the accuracy to a median error of $39\%$. Together, these results provide fitting functions for BCG stellar halos that can be applied to future wide-field surveys to infer halo masses from deep imaging data.
#### The signature of major mergers on the hydrostatic mass bias of galaxy clusters

 - **Abstract**
 While galaxy cluster masses are fundamental cosmological observables, estimates based on intra-cluster medium observations rely on hydrostatic equilibrium, introducing a systematic bias. We investigate how mergers drive the time evolution of this hydrostatic mass bias, identifying the dominant physical mechanisms and their dependence on dynamical state and merger history. Using a high-resolution AMR Eulerian+$N$-body cosmological simulation, we analyse a sample of cluster mergers within $1.5 \leq z \leq 0$, comparing true and hydrostatic masses derived from gas density and temperature profiles, and tracing their evolution. At $z=0$, the hydrostatic mass bias shows a mild correlation with dynamical state. During major mergers, the bias follows a characteristic trend: a sharp negative dip around the merger time, a transient positive peak, and a gradual return to pre-merger levels. This behaviour is primarily driven by morphological and dynamical reconfigurations of the gas density within the ICM, while thermodynamical processes play a secondary role. The pattern shows no strong dependence on secondary parameters, such as mass ratio or impact parameter, but it can be fitted to a simple time-dependent functional form. This trend is present at radii $r\le R_{\mathrm{vir}}$, although with reduced amplitude and shorter timescales as the radius decreases. Hydrostatic mass bias is closely linked, albeit in a non-trivial way, with the merging history of galaxy clusters. We find that the bias values are weakly correlated with the dynamical state of clusters. Nevertheless, our results give a robust estimation of the hydrostatic mass bias values in the pre-merger, merging, and post-merger phases. These findings highlight the importance of delving deeper into the observational assessment of cluster assembly state in order to improve mass estimations for cosmological analyses.
#### Jeans Model for the Shapes of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10765

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10765

 - **Abstract**
 The Jeans model is a semi-analytical approach to modeling self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) that works remarkably well to reproduce the spherically-averaged halo profiles from observations and simulations of relaxed galaxies and galaxy clusters. However, SIDM halos are not spherically symmetric in general since they respond to nonspherical baryon distributions and retain nonsphericity from their initial collapse. In this work, we generalize the Jeans model to describe SIDM density profiles and halo shapes beyond spherical symmetry. Observational tests via halo shapes are especially important for testing SIDM in massive galaxies, $M_{\rm 200} \sim 10^{12} - 10^{13} \; \Msun$, where SIDM and collisionless dark matter halos can have indistinguishable spherically-averaged profiles but distinct halo shapes. We validate our model by comparing to cosmological simulations with baryons for both SIDM with $\sigmam = 1 \cmg$ and collisionless cold dark matter. Our approach differs from previous work in this direction, taking into account the fact that multiple scatterings are required to impact the shape of the halo, as well as being computationally inexpensive to implement. The nonspherical Jeans model can be used in conjunction with halo shape observations (e.g., from gravitational lensing or X-ray data) to directly constrain dark matter self-interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space mission, designed to carry out a large-area sky survey to explore the nature of dark matter and dark energy in the Universe. The onboard multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic modules will enable us to obtain photometric data for billions of galaxies and stars, as well as hundreds of millions of spectroscopic measurements, advancing various scientific analyses such as galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing. To support the image simulations for the main survey of the CSST mission, we present a mock catalogue of stars and galaxies. For stars, the mock catalogue is generated using either Galaxia or TRILEGAL, both of which provide a range of stellar properties to meet the requirements of CSST image simulations. For galaxies, we built a mock light-cone up to redshift z~3.5 from the cosmological Nbody simulation and populated the mock galaxy catalogue from the dark mater haloes using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We then performed a full-sky ray-tracing simulation of weak gravitational lensing to obtain lensing shear at the position of each galaxy in the light-cone. To support both multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic simulations, we computed the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each galaxy based on its star formation history using a supervised deep-learning model and determined the magnitudes in each band using the CSST throughputs. Finally, the properties of our mock galaxies include positions, redshifts, stellar masses, shapes, sizes, SEDs, lensing shears and magnifications. We have validated our mock catalogue against observational data and theoretical models, with results showing good overall agreement. The catalogue provides a flexible dataset for the development of CSST image processing and can support a wide range of cosmological analyses within the CSST mission.
#### A proposal to construct the dark-matter-only counterpart of the observed Universe combining weak lensing and baryon censuses

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic effects such as AGN feedback can significantly impact the matter clustering, are harder to model from first principles, and emerge as a severe limiting factor in weak lensing cosmology. To tackle this issue, we propose a generic relation of mapping the observed matter clustering to its counterpart in a dark-matter-only universe. We verify this relation to be accurate at better than $1\%$ level at $k<1\,h/$Mpc and $z\in [0,3]$ in both TNG and Illustris simulations, demonstrating its model-independence to the underlying baryonic physics. Implementing this relation in observations will be made possible by the specifically designed cross-correlation statistics and baryon census (ionized diffuse gas through localized fast radio bursts, stellar mass through galaxy surveys, and neutral hydrogen through 21cm mapping). It is capable of correcting the baryonic effect not only in the matter power spectrum, but also at the field level, as demonstrated by tests on the scattering transform statistics. This approach paves the way for constructing the dark-matter-only counterpart of the observed Universe, establishing an ideal cosmological laboratory for probing the dark universe.
#### The Spatial Evolution of Star Clusters in NGC 628 with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the spatial distribution of star clusters in NGC 628 using the statistical tool INDICATE to quantify clustering tendencies. Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to >100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in \sim1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs \ge 10^4 M_{\odot}) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters >100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial "structure" in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (\le1 kpc), nuclear ring (\sim0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (\sim1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations. Our results highlight how spatially-resolved studies of clusters can reveal the influence of galactic dynamics on star formation and cluster evolution.
#### Radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of Population III star formation during the Epoch of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological simulations find that pockets of star-forming gas could remain pristine up until the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) due to the inhomogeneous nature of metal mixing and enrichment in the early Universe. Such pristine clouds could have formed Population III stars, which could have distinct properties compared to their very high redshift ($z \geq 20$) counterparts. We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\,\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\star} \approx 70\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\star} > 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment. We find that less massive and more compact Pop III star clusters could form during the EoR as compared to $z \geq 20$, with the formation of very massive and supermassive stars likely in strongly irradiated environments.
#### Star clusters in the gamma-ray sky

 - **Abstract**
 Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as additional contributors to Galactic Cosmic rays (CRs), to overcome the limitations of supernova remnants (SNRs) to reach the highest energy end of the CR spectrum. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies, and their energetics is enough to account for a non-negligible fraction of the Galactic CRs. Anyhow, the theoretical expectations need to be corroborated by clear observations. Despite the increasing number of detections at different energies, the contamination of other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from stellar winds only, unless one selects objects younger than a few million years, namely before stars start to explode inside clusters. I will review the results obtained with gamma-ray data towards a few massive young star clusters and discuss what implications these result have, especially concerning their contribution to the bulk of Galactic CRs.
