 - **Abstract**
 We compile JWST/NIRSpec prism and MIRI data for 249 Little Red Dots (LRDs) at $2.3<z<9.3$, forming a representative spectroscopic subset of NIRCam-selected LRDs. We derive a median stacked spectrum covering rest-frame 0.09-1.2 $\mu$m, with MIRI photometry extending the spectral energy distribution to 4 $\mu$m. Four additional stacks for subsamples defined by optical-to-UV luminosity ratios show that LRDs form a heterogeneous population spanning diverse continuum slopes and line properties. Assuming LRDs host super-massive black holes (BHs) surrounded by dense gas clouds, and stars accompany this core, we infer masses of $M_{BH}\sim10^{6.0-6.5}$~M$_\odot$ and $M_\bigstar\sim10^{8.3}$ M$_\odot$, corresponding to BH-to-stellar mass ratios of 1-2%. The stacks show ubiquitous UV and optical FeII emission, indicating a direct view of the broad-line region and high (but sub-Eddington) accretion ($\lambda_{Edd}=0.6\pm0.2$). We find a significant stellar contribution in the far-UV, reaching $\sim80$% in the bluest systems. Possible Wolf-Rayet features (HeII$\lambda$4687, nitrogen lines) are identified, tracing a young (3-7 Myr) compact starburst event. We also detect strong Balmer breaks and atypical Balmer, Paschen, [OIII], and optical and near-infrared HeI line ratios, and an absorption at $\sim4550$ Angstrom (probably linked to FeII), all consistent with radiative-transfer effects in high-density gas with warm temperatures (4000-7000 K). We find a diversity of LRD flavors modulated by the luminosity ratio between between a short ($\lesssim20$ Myr) and intense phase of BH activity, the most extreme stage lasting $\sim3-7$ Myr, characterized by near-Eddington-limit radiation, and a nuclear and compact starburst dominated by massive stars (even super-massive, $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{SMS}\sim10^{5}$ M$_\odot$), all embedded in dense gas with modest dust content producing a variety of optical depths.

 - **Abstract**
 Emission-line galaxies (ELGs) are an important tracer of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and large-scale structure (LSS) at $z > 1$. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using deep wide-area multi-band imaging (e.g., from the Rubin Observatory) to efficiently select high redshift ELGs. Using Hyper Supreme-Cam $grizy$ photometry and COSMOS2020 many-band photometric redshifts, we designed simple color cuts guided by a probabilistic random forest classifier to select galaxies at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$. We then empirically tested and refined these color cuts using two samples of galaxies with deep spectroscopy and broad color coverage obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Compared to DESI ELGs at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$, we achieve a higher redshift measurement success rate (89% versus 69%), a much higher correct redshift range success rate (84% versus 34%), and a far higher net surface density yield (1372 $\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$ versus 660 $\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$). Combining our sample with current DESI ELGs would increase the net ELG number density by a factor of $\sim3$, moving it out of the shot-noise limited regime and reducing the uncertainties on the BAO scale parameter at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$ by a factor of $\sim 2$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first clear detection of ionized Fe-K emission and absorption components in the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A, revealed by the high-resolution XRISM/Resolve detector. In the 6.5-6.9 keV band, XRISM reveals multiple Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission components. One is a broad (with a width of sigma = 3000 km/s) and redshifted (+3400 km/s) component, originating at D = 0.02 pc from the central black hole. The other two components are narrow (with a width of sigma = 500 km/s) and exhibit redshifted and blueshifted velocities (+2600 km/s and -1500 km/s), originating from more distant regions (D = 0.1 pc). The photo-ionized model explains the broader component, while the two narrower components can be explained by either photo-ionization or collisional ionization. One interpretation is that the broader component is an outflow at ~10^2 R_S (R_S; Schwarzschild radius) and the narrow component is a shock-heated plasma close to the torus, with a possible connection to the JWST-discovered outflow outside the torus. Two blueshifted absorption lines are detected at ~7.1 keV (~10^4 km/s) and ~10.6 keV (~10^5 km/s). The line significance of the 10.6 keV line is above 98%. The absorption line components might be attributed to the broad emission component. These results demonstrate the high potential of XRISM/Resolve to characterize ionized emission and absorption features in the Fe-K band. Our findings establish a new benchmark in the study of circumnuclear environments in low-luminosity radio galaxies, thereby contributing to a broader understanding of AGN unification.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations of HII regions in the Central Molecular Zone have shown a highly filamentary morphology distinct from HII regions in other parts of the galaxy. We present magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of strongly magnetized (plasma-$\beta$ << 1) HII region evolution that investigate and describe the formation of these ionized gas filaments. HII region evolution has been simulated in a 30 pc$^3$ box, in distinct models with pre-placed overdensities in the ambient medium and overdensities that have been generated with driven turbulence. We find that when these overdensities are seeded in the ambient medium before the birth of the ionizing source, the photoionized plasma stripped off of these dense blobs is funneled into long filaments along the magnetic field lines. The length and emission measure of these ionized gas filaments are similar to the filaments observed in the Central Molecular Zone. Given that these filaments are effectively magnetically-confined flows of photoionized gas, their density and curvature are influenced by the density of the blob and the geometry of the configuration.

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae stars are a common, dependable Population II distance indicator, and provide an independent tracer of early star formation. Here, we utilize archival HST/ACS and JWST/NIRCam observations of the nearby dwarf star-forming galaxy WLM to study RR Lyrae in JWST filters. We independently identify RR Lyrae in HST and JWST imaging in order to evaluate JWST's efficacy at characterizing RR Lyrae in the near-IR. We use an MCMC template-fitting technique to obtain periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes from the RR Lyrae time-series data. The spatially overlapping HST and JWST observations allow us to directly compare the same sources observed with the instruments, and calibrate the NIRCam F090W and F150W RR Lyrae period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relation to the Gaia-consistent HST PWZ. We additionally assess the epoch-to-epoch consistency of NIRCam photometry, and find evidence of burn-in. We conclude that the zero-point offset is negligible compared to the uncertainties from the template fitting. We conduct an MCMC fit of the PWZ with both HST and JWST data. Our results are three-fold. First, we find that we can reliably identify RR Lyrae in NIRCam data, but light-curve template fitting proves difficult on short-baseline observations. Second, the HST PWZ fit yields a distance modulus to WLM of $\mu = 24.85\pm0.05$ ($0.93\pm0.02$ Mpc). This is closer than previous measurements, primarily attributed to consistency with the Gaia scale. Lastly, although the JWST PWZ fit has large uncertainties and a poorly-constrained slope, it represents a first-of-its-kind PWZ calibration in NIRCam filters.
