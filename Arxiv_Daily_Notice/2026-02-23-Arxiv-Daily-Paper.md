 - **Abstract**
 Neutral gas outflows play a crucial role in the baryon cycle of galaxies, their properties provide key insights into the transition from star formation to quiescence. In this work, we investigate the neutral gas outflow of 23 massive ($M_\star = 10^{10.1-11.6}\,\rm M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at z=2.82--4.61, selected from the JWST NIRSpec (R~1000) and NIRCam program DeepDive. We trace the neutral gas outflows using the NaI Doublet absorption lines and detect excess NaI D in 13/23 (57%) targets, of which 7/23 (30%) show blueshifted absorption with velocity offsets $|{\Delta}v|$ >~ 150 km/s. The z ~ 3.5 targets have ${\Delta}v$ similar to those of their local counterparts; they are also equivalent when compared in SFR--${\Delta}v$ space. We derive mass outflow rates and identify the most extreme neutral gas outflow rate $\log(\dot M_{\rm out} / \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr}^{-1})=2.68\pm0.27$ beyond the local Universe, coincident with an X-ray AGN. For all NaI D detected systems, the inferred mass outflow rate can, in principle, suppress ongoing star formation; however, the outflows are unlikely to escape their hosts, suggesting recycling on relatively short timescales (~3--180 Myr), depending on the assumed potential and launching radius. All NaI D detected targets occupy the LI(N)ER region of the BPT diagram and/or are X-ray detected, but we find no strong correlation between ongoing AGN and the neutral outflow: 2/4 broad-line/X-ray AGNs are NaI D undetected -- yet, the outflows can be powered by fossil/episodic AGNs, and one broad-line target shows a possible P-Cygni profile that indicates strong outflows. As neutral outflows alone are not able to permanently quench star formation by removing gas in our sample at z ~ 3.5, the presence of gas cycling in and out of massive passive systems may instead be the signature of feedback-regulated quenching-maintenance processes.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers play a crucial role in shaping the morphology, the star formation, and the mass growth of galaxies across cosmic time. While mergers have been extensively investigated in the local Universe, the evolution of their frequency and physical properties in the early Universe has yet to be fully understood. We investigate the role of mergers in a large spectroscopic sample of 1233 galaxies in the range 5<z<14 with good detection (S/N-pixel > 3) in JWST imaging, covering six different extragalactic fields. We identify mergers from rest-frame optical disturbances in F444W, using a combination of Gini, M-20, and Asymmetry parameters. We find a morphological merger fraction f_m that does not strongly evolve with redshift from z=0 to z ~ 8. The average f_m of our primary major merger condition (Gini+0.14xM-20 > 0.33, A>0.35) is ~ 5 %, which increases to ~13 % for major+minor merger tracers. Accounting for the evolving observability timescale of each tracer, we find that the merger rate is strongly increasing from z=1 to 7 by more than 1 dex, averaging ~ 2 merger/galaxy/Gyr at 5<z<10 for major mergers (in agreement with photometric pair studies), and a factor of 3 higher for minor+major mergers. We also perform SED modeling using available HST+JWST photometry to infer stellar masses and SFRs, using a non parametric star-formation history. We find that mergers at z > 5 have a significant impact, although significantly lower than at z<1, on the SFR of galaxies. When averaged over 10 Myr (comparable to the observability timescale of morphological disturbances), their SFRs are a factor of 1.7 higher than a mass and redshift matched sample of non-mergers, suggesting that mergers trigger new star-formation through short-lived powerful bursty episodes. Despite this, mergers contribute only by 5% - 10% to the mass build-up of galaxies in the redshift range explored.
