 - **Abstract**
 The properties of Milky Way satellite galaxies have important implications for galaxy formation, reionization, and the fundamental physics of dark matter. However, the population of Milky Way satellites includes the faintest known galaxies, and current observations are incomplete. To understand the impact of observational selection effects on the known satellite population, we perform rigorous, quantitative estimates of the Milky Way satellite galaxy detection efficiency in three wide-field survey datasets: the Dark Energy Survey Year 6, the DECam Local Volume Exploration Data Release 3, and the Pan-STARRS1 Data Release 1. Together, these surveys cover $\sim$13,600 deg$^2$ to $g \sim 24.0$ and $\sim$27,700 deg$^2$ to $g \sim 22.5$, spanning $\sim$91% of the high-Galactic-latitude sky ($|b| \geq 15^\circ$). We apply multiple detection algorithms over the combined footprint and recover 49 known satellites above a strict census detection threshold. To characterize the sensitivity of our census, we run our detection algorithms on a large set of simulated galaxies injected into the survey data, which allows us to develop models that predict the detectability of satellites as a function of their properties. We then fit an empirical model to our data and infer the luminosity function, radial distribution, and size-luminosity relation of Milky Way satellite galaxies. Our empirical model predicts a total of $265^{+79}_{-47}$ satellite galaxies with $-20 \leq M_V \leq 0$, half-light radii of $15 \leq r_{1/2} (\rm pc) \leq 3000$, and galactocentric distances of $10 \leq D_{\rm GC} (\rm kpc) \leq 300$. We also identify a mild anisotropy in the angular distribution of the observed galaxies, at a significance of $\sim$$2\sigma$, which can be attributed to the clustering of satellites associated with the LMC.

 - **Abstract**
 Close encounters between stars and black holes can trigger micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs) in dense young star clusters (YSCs). Using direct N-body simulations with PETAR, we found that most micro-TDEs arise from few-body multiple encounters. The inferred rate is approximately 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs could be detected both by upcoming surveys such as LSST, expected to observe roughly 10-100 events per year, and by their gravitational-wave (GW) signals peaking in the deci-Hertz band, detectable with future instruments such as LGWA and DECIGO.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) results provided strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (sGWB), consistent with a population of merging massive black holes (MBHs) at $z<1$. Meanwhile, JWST observations at $z>5$ suggest a higher number density of accreting MBHs than previously estimated. Together with constraints from local MBHs and high-$z$ quasars, these findings offer a unique opportunity to test MBH seeding and early growth models. We explore this using ${\tt L-Galaxies}\textit{BH}$, a new extension of the galaxy formation model ${\tt L-Galaxies}$, developed to explicitly model all stages of MBH evolution, including seeding, accretion, and binary dynamics. To take advantage of both the high resolution of the ${\tt MillenniumII}$ and the large volume of the ${\tt Millennium}$ simulations, we run ${\tt L-Galaxies}\textit{BH}$ on the former and use its outputs as initial conditions for the latter, via our $\textit{grafting}$ method. We find that reproducing the number density of high-$z$ active MBHs observed by JWST requires either a heavy seed formation rate significantly higher than that predicted by current models ($\gtrsim 0.01 Mpc^{-3}$ at $z \sim 10$), or widespread formation of light seeds undergoing multiple phases of super-Eddington accretion. Furthermore, matching the amplitude of the PTA sGWB signal requires nearly all galaxies with stellar masses $M_{*}> 10^9 M_\odot$ to host central MBHs by $z\sim0$. Given the extreme heavy seed densities required to satisfy both PTA and JWST constraints, our results favor a scenario in which MBHs originate from light seeds that grow rapidly and efficiently in the early universe. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-messenger data with physical models to probe the origins and evolution of MBHs across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar collisions in dense galactic nuclei might play an important role in fueling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and shaping their environments. The gas released during these collisions can contribute to SMBH accretion, influencing phenomena such as active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events of the remnants. We address the challenge of rapidly and accurately predicting the outcomes of stellar collisionsincluding remnant masses and unbound gasacross a broad parameter space of initial conditions. Existing smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation techniques, while detailed, are too resource-intensive for exploratory studies or real-time applications. We develop a machine learning framework trained on a dataset of $\sim 16,000$ SPH simulations of main-sequence star collisions. By extracting physically meaningful parameters (e.g., masses, radii, impact parameters, and virial ratios) and employing gradient-boosted regression trees with Huber loss, we create a model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. The method includes logarithmic transforms to handle dynamic ranges and regularization to ensure physical plausibility. The model achieves predictions of collision outcomes (remnant masses, and unbound mass) with very low mean absolute errors respect to the typical mass scale. It operates in fractions of a second, enabling large-scale parameter studies and real-time applications. Parameter importance analysis reveals that the impact parameter and the relative velocity dominate outcomes, aligning with theoretical expectations. Our approach provides a scalable tool for studying stellar collisions in galactic nuclei. The rapid predictions facilitate investigations into gas supply for SMBH accretion and the cumulative effects of collisions over cosmic time, particularly relevant to address the growth of SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Local Universe dwarf galaxies are both cosmological and mass assembly probes. Deep surveys have enabled the study of these objects down to the low surface brightness (LSB) regime. In this paper, we estimate Euclid's dwarf detection capabilities as well as limits of its MERge processing function (MER pipeline), responsible for producing the stacked mosaics and final catalogues. To do this, we inject mock dwarf galaxies in a real Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) field in the VIS band and compare the input catalogue to the final MER catalogue. The mock dwarf galaxies are generated with simple Sérsic models and structural parameters extracted from observed dwarf galaxy property catalogues. To characterize the detected dwarfs, we use the mean surface brightness inside the effective radius SBe (in mag arcsec-2). The final MER catalogues achieve completenesses of 91 % for SBe in [21, 24], and 54 % for SBe in [24, 28]. These numbers do not take into account possible contaminants, including confusion with background galaxies at the location of the dwarfs. After taking into account those effects, they become respectively 86 % and 38 %. The MER pipeline performs a final local background subtraction with small mesh size, leading to a flux loss for galaxies with Re > 10". By using the final MER mosaics and reinjecting this local background, we obtain an image in which we recover reliable photometric properties for objects under the arcminute scale. This background-reinjected product is thus suitable for the study of Local Universe dwarf galaxies. Euclid's data reduction pipeline serves as a test bed for other deep surveys, particularly regarding background subtraction methods, a key issue in LSB science.
