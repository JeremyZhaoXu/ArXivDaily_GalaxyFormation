 - **Abstract**
 The formation of dark-matter halos from small cosmological perturbations generated in the early universe is a highly non-linear process typically modeled through N-body simulations. In this work, we explore the use of deep learning to segment and classify proto-halo regions in the initial density field according to their final halo mass at redshift $z=0$. We compare two architectures: a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the V-Net design and a U-Net transformer. We find that the transformer-based network significantly outperforms the CNN across all metrics, achieving sub-percent error in the total segmented mass per halo class. Both networks deliver much higher accuracy than the perturbation-theory-based model \textsc{pinocchio}, especially at low halo masses and in the detailed reconstruction of proto-halo boundaries. We also investigate the impact of different input features by training models on the density field, the tidal shear, and their combination. Finally, we use Grad-CAM to generate class-activation heatmaps for the CNN, providing preliminary yet suggestive insights into how the network exploits the input fields.
#### Effective Theories of Redshift-Space Galaxy Peculiar Velocities

 - **Abstract**
 We present predictions for redshift-space peculiar velocity statistics in the Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations of the effective field theory (EFT) of large-scale structure. We compute 2-point pairwise velocity statistics up to the second moment at next-to-leading (1-loop) order, showing that they can be modeled together with redshift-space galaxy densities with a consistent set of EFT coefficients. We show that peculiar velocity statistics have a distinct dependence on long-wavelength bulk flows that necessitates a variation on the usual infrared (IR) resummation procedure used to model baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy clustering. This can be implemented recursively in powers of the velocity in both the Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks. We validate our analytic calculations against fully nonlinear N-body simulations, demonstrating that they can be used to recover the growth rate at better than percent level precision, well beyond the statistical requirements of upcoming peculiar velocity surveys and measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect. As part of this work, we release $\texttt{velocisaurus}$, a fast $\texttt{Python}$ code for computing EFT predictions of peculiar velocity statistics.
#### Discovery of an $\rm[Fe/H] \sim -4.8$ Star in $Gaia$ XP Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of GDR3_526285 ($Gaia$ DR3 Source ID 5262850721755411072), a star with $\rm[Fe/H] = -4.82 \pm 0.25$ and one of the lowest metal ($\text{atomic number} > 2$) mass fractions ever found ($Z_{\rm GDR3\_526585} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$). We first identified it as an ultra metal-poor (UMP; $\rm[Fe/H] < -4$) red giant-branch (RGB) star candidate in the $Gaia$ BP/RP (XP) spectro-photometric catalog ($Gaia$ $G$ magnitude $\approx$15). A combination of multi-band photometry and high-resolution spectroscopic analysis under local thermodynamic equilibrium confirmed the status of GDR3_526285 as a distant ($\approx$24 kpc from the Sun) RGB star ($T_{\rm eff} = 4596\,{\rm K}$, $\log g = 0.88$) in the Milky Way's outer halo. We obtain only an upper limit for the carbon abundance of $\rm[C/H] < -4.32$, resulting in $\rm[C/Fe] < +0.50$. A correction for the evolutionary carbon depletion ($\Delta \rm[C/Fe] = +0.68$) brings the nominal carbon-to-iron ratio upper limit to $\rm[C/Fe]_{\rm cor} < +1.18$. Given its extraordinarily low [C/H], GDR3_526285 likely formed from gas cooled via dust grains rather than fine structure line cooling. The kinematics of GDR3_526285 suggests that this star was either dynamically perturbed by the infall of the Magellanic system or was formerly a member of the Magellanic Clouds and was later stripped by the Milky Way. Our results showcase the potential of an all-sky search for low-metallicity targets with $Gaia$ XP and confirm that the methodology described here is an useful "treasure map" for finding additional UMP stars.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the first study of the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, omega Centauri, employing recently acquired JWST deep images. By combining these data with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, we derived proper motions (PMs) for a significant portion of the JWST field. Our analysis of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) reveals two prominent sequences extending from a magnitude F322W2 ~ 17.5 to the bottom of the main sequence (MS). These sequences correspond to the two main stellar populations of omega Centauri: the bMS (He-rich) and rMS (He-normal) populations. The two sequences intersect at the MS knee (F322W2 ~ 19.5) and change positions for lower magnitudes, with the bMS luminosity function (LF) ending at least ~0.5 magnitudes brighter than the rMS LF. We identified a third group of stars (named gMS) along the main sequence located between the two primary ones and conducted a detailed analysis of the LFs and MFs for these three stellar populations. The LFs of these sequences show similar trends, with the rMS being the most populated and the bMS the least. The MFs display distinct power-law slopes: the rMS is well fitted by a single power-law while the gMS and the bMS are characterised by MFs steeper than that of the rMS for masses larger than 0.2 solar masses and flatter MFs for smaller masses. The flattening around ~0.2 solar masses for the gMS and the bMS might be a real feature of the MFs of these populations or due to uncertainties in the adopted mass-luminosity relationship (MLR). The variation in the slope of the MFs of the gMS and bMS contributes to the steepening (flattening) of the combined MF for masses higher (lower) than 0.2 solar masses.
#### Exploration of groups and outliers in Gaia RVS stellar spectra with metric learning

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia mission is transforming our view of the Milky Way by providing distances towards a billion stars, and much more. The third data release includes nearly a million spectra from its Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). Identifying unexpected features in such vast datasets presents a significant challenge. It is impossible to visually inspect all of the spectra and difficult to analyze them in a comprehensive way. In order to supplement traditional analysis approaches, and in order to facilitate deeper insights from these spectra, we present a new dataset together with an interactive portal that applies established self-supervised metric learning techniques, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, to allow researchers to visualize, analyze, and interact with the Gaia RVS spectra in straightforward but under-utilized manner. We demonstrate a few example interactions with the dataset, examining groupings and the most unusual RVS spectra, according to our metric. This combination of methodology and public availability enables broader exploration, and may reveal yet-to-be-discovered stellar phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 With over two dozen detections in the Milky Way, double neutron stars (DNSs) provide a unique window into massive binary evolution. We use the POSYDON binary population synthesis code to model DNS populations and compare them to the observed Galactic sample. By tracing their origins to underlying single and binary star physics, we place constraints on the detailed evolutionary stages leading to DNS formation. Our study reveals a bifurcation within the well-known common envelope formation channel for DNSs, which naturally explains an observed split in the orbital periods of the Galactic systems. The two sub-channels are defined by whether the donor star has a helium core (Case B mass transfer) or a carbon-oxygen core (Case C) at the onset of the common envelope, with only the helium core systems eventually merging due to gravitational wave-modulated orbital decay. However, producing DNSs through both sub-channels requires either a generous core definition of $\simeq$ 30% H-fraction or a high common envelope ejection efficiency of $\alpha_{\rm CE}\gtrsim1.2$. By testing different supernova kick velocity models, we find that galactic DNSs are best reproduced using a prescription that favors low velocity kicks ($\lesssim 50 \, \rm km/s$), in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, our models indicate that merging DNSs are born from a stripped progenitor with a median pre-supernova envelope mass $\sim$ 0.2$M_{\odot}$. Our results highlight the value of detailed evolutionary models for improving our understanding of exotic binary star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Many Galactic globular clusters (GCs) originated in diverse host galaxies before being subsequently incorporated into the Milky Way through hierarchical galaxy assembly. Identifying their origins is crucial for revealing galaxy properties at early times. Traditional classification methods relying on dynamical properties face inherent uncertainties stemming from the evolving Galactic potential and complex merger histories. Chemically driven classification confronts a distinct obstacle: multiple populations - abundance variations in light elements of GC members. In this Letter, we identify primordial populations exhibiting lower [Al/Fe] as reliable tracers of their birth environments' chemical evolution. A clear chemical dichotomy emerges between in-situ and accreted GC populations at [Fe/H] > -1.5, particularly in the [Mg/Fe]-[Al/Fe] plane, indicating that their progenitor galaxies have experienced fundamentally different enrichment histories. While our chemically driven classification demonstrates general consistency with dynamically driven classifications, notable discrepancies emerge: NGC 288 and M4 are reclassified as in-situ, and Terzan 9 as accreted. This chemically driven GC classification provides promising application for Galactic archaeology.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnitude gap between the central and satellite galaxies encodes information about the mass accretion history of a dark matter halo, and serves as a useful observational probe for the mass distribution in a halo. In this work, we perform the first weak lensing test of the connections between the magnitude gap and the halo profile. We measure the halo profiles of isolated central galaxies (ICGs) selected primarily from the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample. Halo mass and concentration are inferred by fitting stacked lensing profiles in bins of central luminosity, $L_\mathrm{c}$, and the central-satellite magnitude gap, $L_\mathrm{gap}$. We detect dependence on the magnitude gap in both halo properties. The dependence is the strongest in the ICG luminosity range of $10^{10.3}<L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot]\leq 10^{10.7}$, where halos with smaller gaps have higher masses and lower concentrations. When $10^{10.7} <L_c[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{11.1}$, however, no significant gap dependence is detected. In the range of $10^{9.9}<L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{10.3}$, a disordering of the gap dependence is marginally observable. We compare the observational results with predictions by two lightcone catalogs built from the Illustris TNG300 and the Millennium simulations. The gap dependence in the two mock samples show overall consistency with observations, but neither matches them in all $L_\mathrm{c}$ bins to a quantitative level. We also compare the significance of the gap dependence on halo mass and concentration and find that our measurement prefers gap dependence in both parameters, while the halo mass dependence is preferred over the concentration if only one of the two dependencies is allowed.
#### Chemical abundances of seven stars in the GD-1 stream

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detailed chemical abundances for seven GD-1 stream stars from Subaru/HDS spectroscopy. Atmospheric parameters were derived via color calibrations ($T\rm_{eff}$) and iterative spectroscopic analysis. LTE abundances for 14 elements ($\alpha$, odd-Z, iron-peak, n-capture) were measured. Six stars trace the main orbit, one resides in a `blob'. All exhibit tightly clustered metallicities ([Fe/H] = -2.38, {\bf intrinsic dispersion smaller than 0.05 dex, average uncertainty is about 0.13 dex}). While one star shows binary mass transfer signatures, the other six display consistent abundance patterns (dispersions $<$ uncertainties). Their iron-peak elements (Sc, Cr, Mn, Ni) match Milky Way halo stars. In contrast, Y and Sr are systematically lower than halo stars of similar [Fe/H]. Significantly, six stars show consistently enhanced [Eu/Fe] $\sim$ 0.60 ($\sigma$ = 0.08). A tight Ba-Eu correlation (r = 0.83, p=0.04) exists, with [Ba/Fe] = -0.03 $\pm$ 0.05, indicating a common r-process origin. This extreme chemical homogeneity strongly supports an origin from a single disrupted globular cluster. The lack of light-element anti-correlations may stem from our sample size or the progenitor's low mass.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy is undoubtedly being disrupted in the tidal field of the Milky Way. The Milky Way disc is also found to be in a state of disequilibrium. The role of the Sagittarius in driving or contributing to this disequilibrium has been extensively investigated. Most of these studies, however, assume an initially near-equilibrium disc. It was also hypothesized that the passage of Sagittarius could have increased the star-forming activity in the Solar Neighbourhood. We check whether galaxies that have undergone cosmological evolution are affected by interactions analogous to those between the Sagittarius and the Milky Way. We use the high-resolution simulation TNG50 to look for pairs similar to the Milky Way and Sagittarius. We search within redshift z=1-0 for discs from the MW/M31 sample that interacted with a satellite more massive than 10 billion Msun, had a pericenter smaller than 50 kpc, and was on an approximately polar orbit. We exclude cases where, within 1 Gyr of the pericenter, a similar interaction occurred. In 90 percent of cases, a passage of the Sagittarius analogue had no significant effect on either the vertical velocity field of the disc or the star formation history. A response in vertical stellar kinematics can be found mostly in cold discs and mildly correlates with the strength of interactions. For star formation, the studied interactions had an effect only when little to no star formation was ongoing prior to the interaction, often due to previously disturbed star-forming discs, e.g., from AGN activity. Our results indicate that stellar discs in TNG50 are frequently vertically perturbed preceding pericenter passages of Sagittarius analogues. Future studies using other simulations and extragalactic surveys will help establish whether vertical disequilibrium is a common feature of disc galaxies or an artifact of the specific setup studied.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of large scale magnetic fields in the Universe is widely thought to be from early Universe processes, like inflation or phase transitions. These magnetic fields evolve via magnetohydrodynamic processes until the epoch of recombination. When structures begin to form in the later Universe, the conservation of magnetic flux amplifies the magnetic fields via the adiabatic collapse of gravitationally bound gas clouds hosting the magnetic fields and moves them to smaller scales. In this work, we have semi-analytically studied this forward cascade effect, considering simple models of gravitational collapse of structures. We find that this simple model is able to reproduce the general qualitative features of the evolution of the magnetic field spectrum as seen from magnetized cosmological simulations.
#### A Novel Formation Channel for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the Early Universe via Primordial Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon--dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm b\chi} \gtrsim 0.8 \sigma_{\rm b\chi}$, where $\sigma_{\rm b\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm infall} \gtrsim 10^{-2}-10^{-1} M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ at redshift $z\sim 10-20$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios $q\sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH--DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining high-$z$ sources such as Little Red Dots, and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin, bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.
