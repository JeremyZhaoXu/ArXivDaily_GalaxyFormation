 - **Abstract**
 In data-driven scientific discovery, a challenge lies in classifying well-characterized phenomena while identifying novel anomalies. Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) are among the most massive galaxies at any epoch, and lack ongoing star formation. As systems hosting most of the baryonic mass in the local Universe, they preserve imprints of the quenching mechanisms in the early Universe. We exploited the large BOSS and DESI spectroscopic datasets to perform the first homogeneous and continuous mapping of the evolution of stellar population properties of a complete sample of the most massive LRGs ($\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})> 11.5$) at 0.15 < z < 0.8. By consistently fitting the same spectral indices at all redshifts, we measured trends of [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe], and light-weighted age as a function of redshift. These galaxies exhibit a passive light-weighted age evolution and flat [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] trends towards lower redshift, indicating genuinely passive evolution. These trends are robust against the choice of stellar population models and analysis assumptions, and they support the predictions from IllustrisTNG, which predict negligible chemical evolution for the most massive quenched systems at z < 0.8. Our results suggest that, despite nearly 5 Gyr of cosmic time and a 3-4x increase in number density, the stellar population properties of massive quiescent galaxies remain essentially unchanged since z ~ 0.8. This shows a negligible progenitor bias below z ~ 0.8, and a genuinely passive evolution. Newly added systems after $z \sim 0.8$ were already largely quenched and chemically mature, while subsequent evolution was dominated by dry mergers without altering the bulk of the stellar populations.
#### HR-GO II: chemical abundances of low-$E$ retrograde dynamically-tagged-groups: Revealing Thamnos as a very metal-poor substructure

 - **Abstract**
 Milky Way halo substructures identified in dynamical space are known to suffer from contamination from the Milky Way in-situ stars, which makes their accreted origins uncertain. We present detailed chemical abundances of 35 stars belonging to two sets of dynamically tagged groups, Rg8 and Rg9, to investigate their accreted nature. Both groups are composed of stars with low orbital energy and very retrograde orbits. We find that Rg8 and Rg9 are chemically indistinguishable across all elements, from C to Eu, strongly indicating that they belong to the same structure. The iron-abundance distribution of this low-$E$ retrograde group has a prominent peak at [Fe/H] $\approx-2.1$, revealing that its main population is very metal-poor, and a secondary peak at [Fe/H] $\approx-1.5$, very likely due to contamination from Milky Way in-situ stars. These groups also heavily overlap with the Thamnos substructure in dynamical space, and we thus use them to investigate the chemical properties of Thamnos. The dominant, low-metallicity population provides strong evidence for the ex-situ origin of Thamnos, as well as its very metal-poor nature. We do not see any evidence of an $\alpha$ knee in our sample, which is consistent with previous studies. Comparison with the Cetus-Palca stream in the chemical space shows similar abundance distributions, and thus it suggests that the Thamnos progenitor dwarf galaxy had a truncated star formation history due to its early merger with the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's Galactic Center hosts the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which provides us with a close-up view into supermassive black hole accretion and feedback. Recent works have shown that the winds from $\sim 30$ Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting Sgr A* at about 4 arcsec are important contributors to feeding the supermassive black hole. A nuclear star cluster (NSC) with a mass of several $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$, of which $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$ is within 1 pc, also surrounds Sgr A*. The NSC contributes to the gravitational potential in the Galactic Center, affecting the orbits of the WR stars and their stellar winds. In this work, we examine the effects that the NSC has on the accretion of these stellar winds onto Sgr A* which have previously been neglected. We find that, on the parsec scale, the effect from the gravitational potential of the NSC is negligible on the wind-fed accretion flow, validating the existing simulations used in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 We summarize the current state of the art and calculate gravitational wave strain amplitudes for known binary pulsars, using data from current ground-based detectors (LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA) and the upcoming space-based missions (LISA). We present detailed calculations of the characteristic gravitational wave strain values, ranging from 3.0 to 73 $\times10^{-22}$, across frequencies between 0.66 and 5.87 $\times10^{-4}$ Hz. Our post-Newtonian approximation analysis yields predicted periastron advance rates from 1.6 to 80.5 deg/yr and orbital period decay rates between -5 and -176 $\mu$s/yr for the binary pulsar population. We derive common envelope efficiency parameters ($\alpha_{CE}$) for representative progenitor scenarios within our sample, finding values between 0.63 and 1.16, with notable sensitivity to the binding energy parameter $\lambda$. Binary neutron star merger rates are estimated at $22.77^{+6.83}_{-6.83}$ Myr$^{-1}$ for the Milky Way, corresponding to a volumetric rate of $227.71^{+68.31}_{-68.31}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with the latest LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observational constraints. Our results illustrate how multi-band gravitational wave observations, from LIGO/Virgo to LISA, can contribute to precise measurements of binary pulsar strain and orbital evolution histories, improving merger time predictions and constraining neutron star physics and common envelope processes

 - **Abstract**
 We present new measurements of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) from JWST/NIRCam imaging over the redshift range z=4.5-9.7, using photometric catalogs from JADES and public extragalactic fields. Our analysis includes rest-frame UV and B-band LFs, as well as apparent LFs in F090W, F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W. We present the first constraints on the rest-frame B-band LF at z~7-8 and extend existing measurements at z~5 to M(B) = -18 mag. The B-band LFs evolve more strongly with redshift than UV LFs, though both decline more gradually than predicted by simulations at z>5. No single existing simulation reproduces all observed trends, with discrepancies likely driven by assumptions about binary evolution and stellar population synthesis models. The apparent LFs in F356W and F444W show hints of a bright-end excess at all redshifts, extending to fainter magnitudes at higher redshift. While extreme emission line galaxies may partially account for it, the excess may also indicate a population of moderately red, optically bright sources - potentially dusty star-forming galaxies or obscured AGNs. Finally, we find that rest-frame B-band luminosity correlates more tightly with stellar mass than UV, making it a powerful tracer of mass assembly and reinforcing the diagnostic value of rest-frame optical LFs in uncovering the physical processes that drive early galaxy formation.
#### Discovery of the First Five Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Stars in the LMC

 - **Abstract**
 A substantial fraction of metal-poor stars in the local Milky Way halo exhibit large overabundances of carbon. These stars, dubbed Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, provide crucial constraints on the nature of the early universe including the earliest nucleosynthetic events. Whether these stars exist at similar rates in nearby galaxies is a major open question with implications for the environmental dependence of early chemical evolution. Here, we present the discovery of the first five CEMP stars in the Milky Way's largest dwarf companion, the LMC, using SDSS-V spectra from the BOSS instrument. We measure metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -2.1 to -3.2 and evolutionary state corrected carbon enhancements of [C/Fe] = +1.2 to +2.4, placing these stars among the most metal-poor and carbon-rich ever identified in the LMC. This discovery demonstrates that CEMP stars do exist in the LMC despite previous null detections, and establishes the foundation for measuring the CEMP occurrence rate in this system. Such measurements will provide critical tests of whether environmental differences affect the formation channels and frequencies of these ancient, carbon-rich stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The ongoing Euclid mission aims to measure spectroscopic redshifts for approximately two million galaxies using the H $\alpha$ line emission detected in near-infrared slitless spectroscopic data from the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs). These measurements will reach a flux limit of $5\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ in the redshift range $0.4<z<1.8$, opening the door to numerous investigations involving galaxy evolution, extending well beyond the mission's core objectives. The achieved H $\alpha$ luminosity depth will lead to a sufficiently high sampling, enabling the reconstruction of the large-scale galaxy environment. We assess the quality of the reconstruction of the galaxy cosmic web environment with the expected spectroscopic dataset in EDFs. The analysis is carried out on the Flagship and GAEA galaxy mock catalogues. The quality of the reconstruction is first evaluated using geometrical and topological statistics measured on the cosmic web, namely the length of filaments, the area of walls, the volume of voids, and its connectivity and multiplicity. We then quantify how accurately gradients in galaxy properties with distance from filaments can be recovered. As expected, the small-scale redshift-space distortions, have a strong impact on filament lengths and connectivity, but can be mitigated by compressing galaxy groups before skeleton extraction. The cosmic web reconstruction is biased when relying solely on H $\alpha$ emitters. This limitation can be mitigated by applying stellar mass weighting during the reconstruction. However, this approach introduces non-trivial biases that need to be accounted for when comparing to theoretical predictions. Redshift uncertainties pose the greatest challenge in recovering the expected dependence of galaxy properties, though the well-established stellar mass transverse gradients towards filaments can still be observed.
