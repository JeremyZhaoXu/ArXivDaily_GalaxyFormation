 - **Abstract**
 Galactic centres are highly dynamic regions dominated by a supermassive black hole (BH) surrounded by nuclear star clusters (NSC), molecular gas, and asymmetric matter distributions such as disks or halos. The combined gravitational effects of these components, along with relativistic corrections from the BH's spin, generate strongly nonlinear dynamics and frequent chaotic orbital behaviour. To model this environment, we employ a multipolar expansion potential in which the central compact object is represented by the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov pseudo-Newtonian potential, effectively capturing spin-dependent features of a Kerr-like BH. The surrounding halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution expanded up to third order in multipolar terms to account for realistic asymmetry. Previous studies have mainly explored the influence of multipolar moments and BH spin using Poincare sections, SALI, and related chaos indicators. In this work, we extend these analyses by incorporating stability analysis and basins of convergence to achieve a more complete understanding of the system's dynamics. Stability analysis around equilibrium points provides insight into local behavior, while basins of convergence highlight sensitivity to initial conditions and expose fractal basin boundaries. Our results show that the BH spin significantly reshapes phase space: depending on its magnitude and orientation, it can either amplify chaotic scattering caused by halo asymmetry or stabilize specific orbital families. These findings enhance our understanding of how relativistic spin effects and multipolar mass distributions jointly govern the dynamical architecture of galactic centers.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating, high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts observed from the nuclei of a dozen nearby low-mass galaxies. Their origin remains a puzzle in the physics of accretion variability. Observational data indicate that X-ray and/or optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) may precede QPE detections. Although both kinds of outburst are driven by supermassive black holes, they are more frequently detected in faded active galactic nuclei (AGNs), when the TDE is not happening in a dormant galaxy. In the case of the QPE discovery source, GSN 069, it remains debated whether its past activity arose from a previous AGN phase or from an enhanced TDE rate. Aims. We investigated the origin of the past nuclear activity in GSN 069. Methods. Past AGN activity imprints detectable polarization in optical light, due to the expected delay between direct and scattered light. On 6 September 2019, we targeted GSN 069 with VLT/FORS2 in both imaging polarimetry and spectropolarimetry modes so that its optical polarization could be investigated while the first detected QPE phase was still active. Results. We measured a rising polarization, from ~0% to ~1.5%, as moving away from the nucleus of GSN 069. This rise is probed to be intrinsic to the central engine, confirming the already detected extended emission line region (EELR) by integral field unit data. Conclusions. The increasing radial polarization demonstrates a switched-off nucleus. The polarization angle traces an axis aligned with elongated [OIII], [NII], and H{\alpha} gas distributions, revealing an EELR that may be consistent with relic polarization cones, therefore suggesting the presence of a torus-like structure in the past. Thus, optical polarization echoes geometrically favor a faded AGN as the origin of the EELR rather than a past elevated TDE rate, although the latter cannot be excluded.
#### Bound Dark Energy: Particle Physics model in alignment with recent DESI cosmological measurements
 - **Authors:** Axel de la Macorra, Jose Agustin Lozano Torres
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08943

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08943

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational constraints on the Bound Dark Energy Cold Dark Matter (BDE-CDM) model using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements combined with Planck CMB data and Type Ia supernovae compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, DESY5). In BDE-CDM, dark energy originates from the lightest meson field within a supersymmetric SU(3) dark gauge group with $N_f = 6$ flavors, governed by an inverse power-law potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda_{c}^{4+2/3} \phi^{-2/3}$. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM, the dark energy sector contains no free parameters -- the condensation scale $\Lambda_c$ and transition epoch $a_c$ are determined by gauge coupling unification constraints. The equation of state evolves from relativistic behavior ($w = 1/3$) before condensation through a kinetic-dominated stiff phase ($w \simeq 1$), approaching $w_0 = -0.9298 \pm 0.0003$ at present, with $w > -1$ maintained throughout cosmic history, avoiding phantom-regime instabilities. We obtain $\Lambda_{c} = 43.93 \pm 0.13$~eV and $a_c = (2.489 \pm 0.007) \times 10^{-6}$, consistent with theoretical predictions. The $w_0$-$w_a$ confidence contours are approximately 10,000 times smaller than those of $w_0w_a$CDM while achieving comparable fits, and remain stable across different supernova datasets. Statistical analysis yields $\Delta\mathrm{DIC} = -6.77$ and $\Delta\mathrm{AIC} = -8.97$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM for BAO+DESY5, constituting strong evidence favoring BDE-CDM model. The model predicts distinctive signatures including 25\% enhancement in the matter power spectrum at $k \approx 4.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. These results establish BDE-CDM as a theoretically motivated framework that successfully addresses the DESI-observed preference for dynamical dark energy while connecting particle physics with cosmological observations.
#### Wind-fed Supermassive Black Hole Accretion in the Ultracompact Dwarf Galaxy M60-UCD1

 - **Abstract**
 Ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) are thought to be remnants of stripped galactic nuclei, among which a handful are known to host a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). As in stripped nuclear star clusters, the SMBHs in UCDs may be fed by stellar winds from old stellar populations, in the absence of substantial gas reservoirs and galactic inflows. In this work, we investigate such a wind-fed accretion scenario for M60-UCD1, which harbors a confirmed $2\times10^7~M_\odot$ SMBH and exhibits X-ray emission suggestive of SMBH accretion signature. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we simulate the SMBH accreting stellar winds from approximately 1500 asymptotic giant branch stars, and explore the role of ram pressure from the ambient interstellar or intracluster medium. After 5 Myr, the majority of the stellar winds form a cold gas disk ($\sim1000~M_\odot$) within $\sim10~\rm pc$ as well as the SMBH's gravitational sphere of influence. Within the inner $10^4~r_{\rm g}$, this disk transitions into a hot ($\sim10^7-10^9~\rm K$), geometrically thick corona that dominates the X-ray emission. The SMBH achieves an accretion rate of $\sim10^{-5}~M_\odot~\rm yr^{-1}$, yielding an X-ray luminosity of $\sim7\times10^{37}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, well consistent with observations. Including ram pressure stripping reduces both the accretion rate and luminosity by about a factor of two. Our results suggest that the X-ray counterpart of M60-UCD1 originates from a weakly accreting SMBH fed by stellar winds, with broader insights into the feeding mechanisms of central massive black holes and the origins of X-ray sources in other UCDs.

 - **Abstract**
 Interference of the ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field generates time-varying gravitational potential fluctuations, which stochastically heat stellar systems embedded in ULDM halos. Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints.
#### Discovery of a new open cluster as a companion to Czernik 38 cluster and its associated complex tide, using Gaia DR3
 - **Authors:** Nasser M. Ahmed

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09670

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09670

 - **Abstract**
 We utilize Gaia DR3 data to report the discovery of a new star cluster, Nasser 1, located 32 arcmin from Czernik 38 at coordinates $\alpha= 282.11 \pm 0.05$ and $\delta= 4.56 \pm 0.05$. Using a variable membership probability threshold technique with pyUPMASK, we confirm Nasser 1 as a genuine open cluster. It exhibits a distinct King profile and a well-defined CMD with an age of $125.0 \pm 12.30$ Myr, a distance modulus of $12.87 \pm 0.21$ mag, and a color excess of $2.42 \pm 0.09$. Nasser 1 shares consistent physical parameters (age, distance, kinematics, and reddening) with Czernik 38, suggesting they constitute a young primordial binary system in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm. Both clusters display elongations indicative of differential rotation tides; Nasser 1 is additionally perturbed by the spiral arm's gravitational field. Gaussian mass function analysis suggests the two were formerly a single cluster, violently torn apart by differential rotation.
