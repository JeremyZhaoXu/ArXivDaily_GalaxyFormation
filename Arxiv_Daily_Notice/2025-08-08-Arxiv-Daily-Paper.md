 - **Abstract**
 Modelling perturbations of the Milky Way (MW) halo induced by the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) offers new avenues to constrain the dark matter (DM) distribution in our Galaxy. A key observable is the reflex motion of the MW disc with respect to the halo induced by the LMC's infall, which imprints a velocity dipole on kinematics of halo stars. Here we investigate how the dipole varies with Galactocentric radius, and study the sensitivity of the reflex motion signal to different DM outer-halo profiles. Using a suite of basis function expansion (BFE) simulations with truncated NFW profiles ($\rho \propto r^{-\beta}$ beyond $r=50$ kpc), our $N$-body models show that (i) The reflex motion amplitude varies with Galactocentric radius but is largely insensitive to the outer DM slope, implying that the MW-LMC mass ratio alone does not set the dipole strength. (ii) In contrast, the direction of the disc motion is very sensitive to the density distribution of the outer DM halo. (iii) The contraction of the MW halo induced by the LMC's gravitational pull also depends strongly on the outer DM halo profile. (iv) We find a halo instability whose oscillation frequency increases with $\beta$ producing a potentially observable signature - a sinusoidal pattern of the mean radial velocity of halo stars. Finally, using BFE coefficients we find that steeper truncations produce smaller dipole distortions, while amplifying the quadrupole distortion. These results highlight the limited constraining power of the reflex motion amplitude alone for outer MW profile parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first application of semi-coherent strategies in the search for optical pulsations from binary systems, which resulted in the tightest constraints on pulsations from Sco X-1. We analysed observations from the SiFAP2 fast photometer mounted at the TNG spread across four years, for a total of $\sim$56 ks divided in two datasets. The great efficiency of semi-coherent techniques when only limited knowledge on the orbital parameters is available allowed us to set an upper limit at $9.23 \cdot 10^{-5}$ in pulsed amplitude for this source, improving on previous results by a factor of 4. Reaching the same upper limit with fully coherent searches would have required a number of trials more than two orders of magnitude larger. We also applied the same algorithm to an optical observation of a system containing a known pulsar, PSR J1023+0038, ignoring the refined knowledge of the orbital parameters that was allowed by the identification of the pulsar itself in the radio band: through this analysis, we proved that detection of the pulsar would have followed even with data in the optical band alone.
#### AGN Feedback Models and AGN Demographics I: Radio-Mode AGN in EAGLE, SIMBA and TNG100 are Inconsistent with Observations
 - **Authors:** Arjun Suresh, Michael R. Blanton, Douglas Rennehan

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04907

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04907

 - **Abstract**
 We compare predictions of how Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) populate host galaxies at low redshifts to observations, finding large discrepancies between cosmological simulation predictions and observed patterns. Modern cosmological simulations include AGN feedback models tuned to reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function. However, due to a lack of real understanding of the physics of AGN feedback, these models vary significantly across simulations. To distinguish between the models and potentially test the underlying physics, we carry out independent tests of these models. In an earlier study, we found that $F_{\rm AGN}$ -- the observed completeness-corrected fraction of galaxies hosting radio AGN with an Eddington ratio $\lambda > 10^{-3}$ -- to be a strong function of host galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) but nearly independent of host specific star formation rates (sSFR) at fixed $M_\star$. In this study, we test the radio mode AGN feedback models of the EAGLE, SIMBA, and TNG100 simulations by comparing their predictions of $F_{\rm AGN} \left(M_\star \right)$ to our observational constraint. We find that none of these simulations even qualitatively reproduce the observed dependencies of $F_{\rm AGN}$ on $M_\star$ and sSFR. Finally, we find that although the given TNG100 model could be modified in order to better reproduce the observed $F_{\rm AGN}$ trend, this modification would likely also change its prediction for the local stellar mass function and star formation rates -- key observations used for calibrating the simulation in the first place. Our findings highlight a pressing need to revisit the AGN feedback prescriptions in EAGLE, SIMBA, TNG100 and other similar models.
#### CLASH-VLT: The variance of the velocity anisotropy profiles of galaxy clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The velocity anisotropy profiles, $\beta(r)$, of galaxy clusters are directly related to the shape of the orbits of their member galaxies. Knowledge of $\beta(r)$ is important to understand the assembly process of clusters and the evolutionary processes of their galaxies, and to improve the determination of cluster masses based on cluster kinematics. We determine the $\beta(r)$ of nine massive clusters at redshift $0.19 \leq z \leq 0.45$ from the CLASH-VLT data set, with 150 to 950 spectroscopic members each, to understand how much cluster-to-cluster variance exists in the $\beta(r)$ of different clusters and what is the main driver of this variance. We select spectroscopic cluster members with the CLUMPS algorithm calibrated on cosmological simulations. We apply the MAMPOSSt code to the distribution of cluster members in projected phase-space to constrain the cluster mass profile, $M(r)$, using priors derived from a previous gravitational lensing analysis. Given the MAMPOSSt best-fit solution for $M(r)$, we then solve the inversion of the Jeans equation to determine $\beta(r)$ without assumptions of its functional form. We also run the DS+ code to identify subclusters and characterize the dynamical status of our clusters. The average $\beta(r)$ is slightly radial, with the anisotropy increasing from $\beta \simeq 0.2$ at the cluster center, to $\beta \simeq 0.4$ at the virial radius. There is substantial variance in the $\beta(r)$ of the individual clusters, that cannot be entirely accounted for by the observational uncertainties. Clusters of lower mass and with a low concentration per given mass have more tangential $\beta(r)$'s. Clusters hosting a rich subcluster have $\beta(r)$ deviating more strongly from the average $\beta(r)$.
