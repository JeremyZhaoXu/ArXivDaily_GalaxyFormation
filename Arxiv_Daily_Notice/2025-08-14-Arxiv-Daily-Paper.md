 - **Abstract**
 Polarization observations of tidal disruption events offer unique insights into the accretion processes around supermassive black holes. Here, we present optical polarization observations of the nearby event AT 2023clx, obtained using the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our observations reveal a rise and subsequent decay in the polarization degree, temporally offset from the peak of the optical light curve, reaching maximum intrinsic polarization degree of $\sim$5 per cent. In addition, the polarization angle shifts by $\sim60^\circ-100^\circ$ between 6 to 20 days after the optical peak, remaining stable thereafter. Remarkably, the observed polarization variability closely resembles that of AT 2020mot, strongly suggesting a common mechanism for accretion disk formation in these events. The variability in both polarization degree and angle supports models in which tidal stream shocks drive the optical outburst during the accretion disk formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting Population III (Pop. III) stars remains a major observational challenge. Their Balmer series recombination line emission, redshifted into the infrared at $z \sim 5-11$, is a potential tracer. JWST/NIRSpec offers the first opportunity to detect such lines, provided fluxes exceed instrumental sensitivity. This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first four Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess their detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across $5 \leq z \leq 11$. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting Milky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc$/h$ box. Predicted fluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop. III H$\alpha$ fluxes peak at $\sim10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, 2-3 orders of magnitude below the JWST detection threshold ($\sim6 \times 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). The fluxes in the other Balmer series lines are weaker than H$\alpha$ and hence are also not detectable. Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing photon escape fraction $f_{\mathrm{esc,III}}$ has the strongest effect on Pop. III Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing $f_\mathrm{esc,III}$ from 0.9 to 0.1 increases the fluxes by $\gtrsim$1 order of magnitude. However, even in this case, the lines remain undetectable. Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be undetectable by JWST without strong lensing ($\mu \gtrsim 10$). A-SLOTH provides a useful tool to predict emission strengths and assess the detectability of Pop. III stars across cosmic history.
#### AT2022sxl: A Candidate Repeating Tidal Disruption Event in Possible Association with Two High-Energy Neutrino Events

 - **Abstract**
 We report a candidate repeating tidal disruption event (TDE), AT2022sxl, found from large-field optical survey data. Two flares with a separation time of $\sim$7.2\,yr between the two optical peaks are observed. Related mid-infrared (MIR) flares, with delay times of $\sim$200\,day are also seen. We analyze two optical spectra of the TDE source, onenear the optical peak of the second flare from the Transient Name Server and one at the quiescent flux level after the second flare. The latter was taken by us with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Comparing the features of the two spectra, we identify that the host is likely a composite galaxy at redshift 0.23 and the TDE event, probably an H+He type, mainly powered broad components in the emission lines of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and He~I $\lambda$5876. More interestingly, we find that two Bronze-type neutrino events, detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory, match the TDE in position and the second flare, especially the delayed MIR flare, in time. We discuss the MIR luminosity properties of the currently reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting TDEs and suggest that luminous MIR emission is a prerequisite for neutrino production in TDEs.
