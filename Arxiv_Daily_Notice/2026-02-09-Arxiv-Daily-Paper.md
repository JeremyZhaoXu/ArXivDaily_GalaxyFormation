 - **Abstract**
 Given the persistence of various tensions in the "Cosmic Concordance" -- such as the "Hubble Tension", and the possible departure from LambdaCDM time evolution -- seen when combining complementary data sets (CMB studies, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, etc.), it remains an ongoing possibility for these to have a real cosmological origin. If one assumes such deviations to be real, a model-independent formalism (cosmography) is useful for locating the source of the problem with concordance cosmology. The extraordinarily good fit of LambdaCDM to the CMB data shows that it was a successful model of the universe at high redshift. Yet at lower redshift -- when the dark energy density becomes significant, and its precise physical nature becomes important -- the universe may have gone off the track of simple LambdaCDM. Here we use linear cosmography fits to binned Supernova data to reconstruct the detailed temporal history of the Hubble parameter, thus probing for interesting time-dependent behaviors of the expansion rate during and after the onset of cosmic acceleration. Using combined Type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey 5-Year data release and the Union2.1 compilation, we find intriguing hints of an oscillatory pattern in the Hubble parameter during the acceleration era. While these hints are low-significance, and not robust under different redshift binnings, we present this work as a proof-of-concept demonstration of this method for reconstructing the Hubble parameter evolution, which may be useful for the voluminous Supernova data sets anticipated to become available during the next few years.
#### The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: Detection of splashback radii in galaxy cluster total light stacks

 - **Abstract**
 The splashback radius, the radius of the apocenter of the first orbit of infalling material, is a measurable quantity marking the boundary between a galaxy cluster and its infalling region. We report detections of splashback radii in total light stacks, i.e. image stacks centered on the cores of galaxy clusters. Our analysis uses Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1 and W2 images of 83,345 candidate clusters at $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.9$ from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). The clusters are organized in stacks by redshift and signal-to-noise ($S\slash N$) ratios. We adopt a statistical approach, using 1000 bootstrap realizations to determine the median projected splashback radius and its confidence interval in a given bin. We compare our splashback radii with the measurements made by K. Thongkham et al. on a similar sample of MaDCoWS2 clusters using galaxy-cluster cross-correlation and find that they are consistent, although our method yields larger error bars. Our main systematic error is the accuracy of the background subtraction, but its impact remains small: the consistency of K. Thongkham et al. and our results suggests that neither method suffers from large systematics. The sensitivity of total light stacking to the contribution of faint galaxies can be advantageous to locate splashback radii when only the brightest galaxies are detected in individual images, such as at high redshifts. We present a potential application of this new technique to probe the evolution of the stellar mass in cluster infalling regions.
