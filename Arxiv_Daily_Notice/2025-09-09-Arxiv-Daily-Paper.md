#### A critical analysis of the recent OGLE limits on stellar mass primordial black holes in the halo of the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is a response to recent claims that a population of primordial black holes in the Galactic halo has been ruled out by the OGLE collaboration. This claim was based on the latest results from the OGLE microlensing survey towards the Large Magellanic Cloud which failed to detect even the number of events expected from known stellar populations. In particular, their results are completely inconsistent with the results of the MACHO survey which detected a population of compact bodies in the Galactic halo which could not be accounted for by any known stellar population. The discrepancy between the results of these two groups has a long history, and includes problems such as different choice of photometric passbands, quality of light curves, microlensing event selection, detection efficiency, self lensing and halo models. In this paper it is demonstrated that these issues not only account for the discrepancy between the OGLE and MACHO results, but imply that the OGLE observations can put no meaningful constraints on a population of primordial black holes in the Galactic halo.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hydrogen-alpha (Ha) emission line in galaxies is a powerful tracer of their recent star formation activity. With the advent of JWST, we are now able to routinely observe Ha in galaxies at high redshifts (z > 3) and thus measure their star-formation rates (SFRs). However, using "classical" SFR(Ha) calibrations to derive the SFRs leads to biased results because high-redshift galaxies are commonly characterized by low metallicities and bursty star-formation histories, affecting the conversion factor between the Ha luminosity and the SFR. In this work, we develop a set of new SFR(Ha) calibrations that allow us to predict the SFRs of Ha-emitters at z > 3 with minimal error. We use the SPHINX cosmological simulations to select a sample of star-forming galaxies representative of the Ha-emitter population observed with JWST. We then derive linear corrections to the classical SFR(Ha) calibrations, taking into account variations in the physical properties (e.g., stellar metallicities) among individual galaxies. We obtain two new SFR(Ha) calibrations that, compared to the classical calibrations, reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) in the predicted SFRs by $\Delta$RMSE $\approx$ 0.04 dex and $\Delta$RMSE $\approx$ 0.06 dex, respectively. Using the recent JWST NIRCam/grism observations of Ha-emitters at z ~ 6, we show that the new calibrations affect the high-redshift galaxy population statistics: (i) the estimated cosmic star-formation density decreases by $\Delta\rho$(SFR) $\approx$ 12%, and (ii) the observed slope of the star-formation main sequence increases by $\Delta$ $\partial$log SFR / $\partial$log M* = 0.08 $\pm$ 0.02.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiwavelength analyses of astrophysical transients are essential for understanding the physics of these events. To make such analyses more efficient and effective, we present the Open mulTiwavelength Transient Event Repository (OTTER), a publicly available catalog of published transient event metadata and photometry. Unlike previous efforts, our data schema is optimized for the storage of multiwavelength photometric datasets spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Open source software, including an application programming interface (API) and web application, are available for viewing, accessing, and analyzing the dataset. For the initial release of OTTER, we present the largest ever photometric archive of tidal disruption events (TDEs), including $\gtrsim 80,000$ observations of 232 TDEs spanning from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We demonstrate the power of this infrastructure through four example analyses of the TDE population. We plan to maintain this dataset as more TDEs are discovered in the future and encourage other users to contribute by uploading newly published data via our web application. The infrastructure was built with the goal of archiving additional transient data (supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, fast blue optical transients, fast radio bursts, etc.) in the future. The web application is available at this https URL and the API documentation is available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation in subhalos using a sample of six Milky Way-like galaxies from the Aurgia simulation suite. We quantify the enhancement in the annihilation rate in subhalos when including the contribution from particles in the smooth component of the halo that overlap with the subhalos. The enhancement in the annihilation rate scales with the smooth component of the host halo dark matter density, and is evident for subhalos over the resolvable mass range. Maximal enhancement factors are ~ 48 for p-wave models, and ~ 37,000 for d-wave models. For p and d-wave annihilation models, ~ 13 and ~ 6 subhalos, respectively, across all six host halos have emission from dark matter annihilation in their direction that is above the foreground emission from the smooth dark matter component, and would therefore be resolvable as sources. Such subhalos with the most significant enhancement factors tend to be on the lower end of the mass range and located closer to the center of the host galaxy. We provide a prescription to calculate the enhancement for subhalos as a function of distance from the Galactic center, and use this to examine the impact on dark matter limits from a couple of example dwarf spheroidals. We show that, including the enhancement factors, limits from individual dwarf spheroidals are at a cross section scale that may approach those derived from the Galactic center.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the evolution of the physical properties of the brightest galaxies in clusters and their protohalos from $z = 4$ to $z = 0$. Galaxy clusters and groups are identified using a halo-based group finder applied to the COSMOS2020 galaxy catalog. We construct evolution chains from low redshift clusters to higher redshift groups via the abundance matching method. The region of protohalos corresponding to clusters is defined on the basis of a characteristic radius. Our analysis encompasses a wide range of physical properties, including stellar mass, luminosity, star formation rate (SFR), specific star formation rate (sSFR), color ($g - r$), and stellar age. The evolution trends of the most massive galaxies (MMGs) in higher redshift groups and their corresponding protohalos are generally consistent. The stellar mass of MMGs shows an increasing trend across the entire redshift range. By considering the stellar mass growth as in-situ and ex-situ components, we find that in-situ star formation is efficient at $z \sim 2$, while ex-situ accretion becomes the primary growth channel at later times. At $z \gtrsim 2$, MMGs undergo an intense star formation phase of approximately $10^{2}\ \rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$, but are generally quenched at lower redshifts. Stellar age analysis suggests that most stars in MMGs formed at $z > 2$. Our results present a coherent picture of MMG evolution across cosmic epochs, which is broadly consistent with the current theoretical framework of galaxy formation and evolution. Moreover, our work provides an intriguing way to trace galaxy evolution through the construction of cluster evolutionary chains in observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of galaxy formation processes on the matter power spectrum is uncertain and may bias cosmological parameters inferred by large-scale structure surveys. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), through their dispersion measures (DMs) encoding the integrated column density of baryons, offer a unique window into the distribution of gas. In this work, we investigate the constraining power of a 3x2-point correlation statistic of FRB DMs and galaxies. We present the correlation formalism, derive covariance matrices and forecast signal-to-noise ratios and Fisher parameter constraints. Assuming host galaxy DM variance of 90 pc cm$^{-3}$, for $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRBs across 35% of the sky, the angular DM power spectrum is noise dominated at multipoles $\ell \gtrsim 20$ ($\ell \gtrsim 100$), which implies that the analysis can be conducted using arcmin-scale localizations, where the redshift distribution of the FRB population can be modeled through the FRB luminosity function or FRB position cross-correlations with galaxies. We show that while $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRB DM correlations can constrain cosmological parameters at 40-70% (30-40%) level, this is a factor of 2-3 (1.5-2) weaker than the precision attainable with galaxy clustering alone due to shot noise from the limited FRB number density, variance of the field and host DMs. On the contrary, feedback-sensitive scales are not accessible in galaxy surveys. We demonstrate that combining FRB DMs and galaxies auto- and cross-correlations in a 3x2-point analysis breaks feedback-cosmology degeneracies, yielding 10-18% (7-13%) precision on cosmological parameters and 3% (2%) constraints on feedback using $10^4$ ($10^5$) FRBs. This work positions the 3x2-point statistic of FRB DMs and galaxies as a promising multi-probe strategy, bridging the gap between constraining astrophysical feedback models and precise measurement of cosmological parameters.
#### Disentangling Milky Way halo populations at low metallicities using [Al/Fe]

 - **Abstract**
 Differentiating between in-situ and accreted populations in the Milky Way halo is a challenging task. Various kinematic spaces are often used to identify distinct accreted populations from the in-situ Milky Way halo. However, this approach has limitations, especially at low orbital energies. To overcome this ambiguity, elemental abundances are typically used to distinguish between the populations. Yet, for many elemental abundance ratios, it remains difficult to make this distinction at low metallicities. Aluminium abundances, on the other hand, have been empirically found to be an effective discriminator, allowing for the separation of accreted and in-situ populations in the Milky Way halo even at low metallicities and low orbital energies. We aim to test the discriminating power of [Al/Fe] using a well-studied sample of high-velocity stars in the solar vicinity with high-quality spectra. With these stars, we explore the [Al/Fe] ability to separate the in-situ from accreted stars and test its limitations. We derived aluminium abundances from the Al I 3944 and 3961 {\rm Å} lines for 45 stars observed in two ESO programmes, along with 11 stars with archival spectra. Aluminium abundances were determined using 1D LTE and 1D NLTE spectral synthesis and line profile fitting. We confirm that the low-$\alpha$ population systematically has lower [Al/Fe] compared to high-$\alpha$ stars. Aluminium abundances, when carefully measured and NLTE effects taken into account, are effective tracers of the chemical history of halo stars. They provide an independent constraint on origin, complementing $\alpha$-element abundances trends, and help us to disentangle subpopulations within the accreted halo, especially in the metal-poor regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematics of the Milky Way bulge is known to be complex, reflecting the presence of multiple stellar components with distinct chemical and spatial properties. In particular, the bulge hosts a bar structure exhibiting cylindrical rotation, and a central velocity dispersion peak extending vertically along the Galactic latitude. However, due to severe extinction and crowding, observational constraints near the Galactic plane are sparse, underscoring the need for additional data to improve the completeness and accuracy of existing kinematic maps, and enabling robust comparison with dynamical models. This work aimed to refine the existing analytical models of the Galactic bulge kinematics by improving constraints in the innermost regions. We present updated maps of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion by incorporating new data near the Galactic plane. We combined radial velocity measurements from the GIBS and APOGEE surveys with both previously published and newly acquired MUSE observations. A custom\ -- developed Python\ -- based tool, {\tt PHOTfun}, was used to extract spectra from MUSE datacubes using PSF photometry based on DAOPHOT-II, with an integrated GUI for usability. The method included a dedicated extension, {\tt PHOTcube}, optimized for IFU datacubes. We applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to identify and correct for foreground contamination and to derive new analytical fits for the velocity and velocity dispersion distributions. Our analysis included nine new MUSE fields located close to the Galactic plane, bringing the total number of mapped fields to 57 including ~23000 individual RV measured. The updated kinematic maps confirm the cylindrical rotation of the bulge and reveal a more boxy morphology in the velocity dispersion distribution, while preserving a well\ -- defined central peak.
#### Auriga Streams III: the mass-metallicity relation does not rule out tidal mass loss in Local Group satellites

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The mass-metallicity relation is a fundamental galaxy scaling law that has been extended to the faintest systems in the Local Group. The small scatter in this relation has been used to argue against severe tidal mass loss in Local Group satellites. Aims. We aim to show that the observed scatter is consistent with tidal mass loss seen in cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, using simulated Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga project as an example. Methods. We analyze the stellar masses and mean metallicites for all accreted systems in Auriga. We compute these quantities two ways: considering the total system (bound + lost material) and only considering the bound progenitor. For both cases we fit the mass-metallicity relation and consider properties that drive scatter about these relations. Results. Accreted systems in Auriga have a tight relation between total stellar mass and metallicity, with scatter at a fixed stellar mass driven by age. When only considering the bound progenitor, the tidally evolved mass-metallicity relation has similar scatter ($\sim$0.27 dex) as observed for the Milky Way and M31 satellites ($\sim$0.23 dex). Satellites that lie above the relation have experienced substantial mass loss and typically have low metallicity for their total stellar mass. Even satellites that fall exactly on the evolved relation can lose over half of their stellar mass. Only satellites that are substantially below the evolved relation are reliably intact. Conclusions. The small scatter in the observed mass-metallicity relation is compatible with tidal mass loss. Based on their offset from the observed relation, we predict which Milky Way and M31 satellites have experienced substantial mass loss. These predictions will be tested with deep resolved-star observations from upcoming facilities including Rubin LSST, Euclid, and Roman.
