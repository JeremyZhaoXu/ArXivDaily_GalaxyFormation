 - **Abstract**
 Protoclusters represent the most extreme environments in the very early Universe. They form from large-scale dark matter overdensities, harbouring an overabundance of galaxies fed by large gas reservoirs. Their early and accelerated evolution results in a distinct difference in the properties of galaxies resident in protoclusters versus the field, which is known to be in place by $z\sim 5-6$. We utilise JWST NIRCam observations of the A2744-z7p9OD protocluster at $z=7.88$ to constrain the properties of resident galaxies. We identify seven new protocluster members, bringing the total number to 23 and the total stellar mass of the protocluster to in excess of $10^{10}\ \rm{M_{\odot}}$. These galaxies are remarkably evolved just 650 Myr after the Big Bang, preferentially showing redder UV-slopes and stronger Balmer breaks than is typical of field galaxies. We use the PROSPECTOR spectral energy distribution fitting code to derive key galaxy properties, finding distinct populations in the core versus the outskirts of the protocluster. The core is largely composed of dusty, massive galaxies which can be characterised as undergoing a synchronised (mini)-quenched phase, while galaxies in the protocluster outskirts are undergoing recent bursts of star formation. Finally, a strong suppression of the continuum around the Ly$\alpha$-break evidences extreme neutral hydrogen column densities in many resident galaxies ($N_{\rm HI}\gtrsim10^{23}\ {\rm cm^{-2}}$). The A2744-z7p9OD system is the most extreme, evolved overdensity yet observed at $z>7$, with higher stellar masses, gas densities, and dust attenuation, revealing the intersection of local environment and high-redshift galaxy formation at their extremes.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of fast-moving stars in the core of Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen), the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, has provided strong evidence for the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). As $\omega$ Cen, is likely the accreted nucleus of a dwarf galaxy, this IMBH also represents a unique opportunity to study BH seeding mechanisms and their potential role in the formation of supermassive BHs. We present Monte Carlo $N$-body models of $\omega$ Cen with detailed treatments for the loss cone dynamics involving stars, binaries, and compact objects. Starting with BH seeds of $500-5000 \, M_{\odot}$ (consistent with runaway collisions of massive stars), our cluster models grow IMBHs with masses of $\sim50{,}000 \, M_{\odot}$ after 12 Gyr, while successfully reproducing the present-day surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of $\omega$ Cen. We find a population of fast stars similar to those observed in the core of $\omega$ Cen, with the fastest stars originating from binaries that were tidally disrupted by the IMBH. The IMBH growth is primarily driven by mergers with $30-40 \, M_{\odot}$ BHs, suggesting a present-day IMBH-BH merger rate of $\sim(4-8)\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in $\omega$ Cen-like GCs. Our models also predict a similar rate of tidal disruption events ($\sim5\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$) which, depending on the frequency of $\omega$ Cen-like GCs per galaxy, may represent anywhere from $0.1\%$ to $10\%$ of the observed TDE rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that tidal disruption events (TDEs) with off-axis jets may manifest as optically overluminous events. To search for jet signatures at late times, we conducted radio observations of eight such optically overluminous ($M_{g, \rm peak} < -20.8$ mag) TDEs with the Very Large Array. We detect radio counterparts in four events. The observed radio luminosities ($L_{\rm 6 GHz} \sim 10^{38}$--$10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$) are two orders of magnitude lower than those of on-axis jetted TDEs, and we find no evidence for off-axis jets within rest-frame time of 3 yrs. Two of them (AT2022hvp and AT2021aeou) exhibit evolving radio emission, consistent with synchrotron emission from non-relativistic outflows launched near the time of first optical light. Two events (AT2020ysg and AT2020qhs) show no statistically significant variability, which can be attributed to either non-relativistic outflows or pre-existing active galactic nuclei. Compared to a control sample of fainter TDEs with $M_{g, \rm peak} > -20.5$ mag observed at similar rest-frame timescales ($t_{\rm rest} ~ 1.5$\,yr), our sample shows systematically more luminous radio emission, suggesting that optically overluminous TDEs may launch more powerful prompt non-relativistic outflows. We speculate that strong general relativistic effects near high-mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH} ~ 10^8\,M_\odot$) may play a key role. These findings motivate further investigation into the nature of relativistic disruptions around massive black holes and the physical conditions necessary for jet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids (CCs) are important probes for the large-scale warp structure of the Milky Way. Using Gaia DR3 CCs, we establish an optimal time-dependent warp model, where the warp height increases with radius following a power-law, the line of nodes (LONs) exhibit linear twisting with radius, following a leading spiral pattern, and the LONs undergo prograde evolution over time. Structurally, we identify significant warp features in the $5-9$ kpc region of the Galactic disk, where the warp model performs better than the flat model. Beyond 15 kpc, the model with the second Fourier term does not fit the observations well, whereas the model with twisted LONs better matches the data. Kinematically, we derived expressions for the vertical velocities using direct differentiation and then calculated the precession rates for each CC. Our results intuitively indicate a nearly uniform and low warp precession rate of $\omega = 4.86 \pm (0.88)_{stat} \pm (2.14)_{sys}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ beyond 12.5 kpc, in agreement with classical kinematic estimates. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet comprehensive time-dependent warp model, $Z_{w}(t) = 0.00019R^{3.08}\sin(\phi - (3.87R-41.79 + 4.86t))$, which provides a unified framework for describing both the geometric and kinematic evolution of the Galactic warp. We analyzed the impact of the adopted solar vertical velocity on the inferred warp precession rate and confirmed the reliability of the measured precession rate. In addition, we found that extinction treatment affects the warp amplitude in the inner disk, while its influence on the outer disk warp structure and the precession rate is negligible.

 - **Abstract**
 We measure three-dimensional bispectra of halo intrinsic alignments (IA) and dark matter overdensities in real space from N-body simulations for halos of mass $10^{12}-10^{12.5} M_\odot /h$. We show that their multipoles with respect to the line of sight can be accurately described by a tree-level perturbation theory model on large scales ($k\lesssim 0.11\,h$/Mpc) at $z=0$. For these scales and in a simulation volume of 1 Gpc/$h$, we detect the bispectrum monopole $B_{\delta\delta E}^{00}$ at $\sim 30\sigma$ and the two quadrupoles $B_{\delta \delta E}^{11}$ and $B_{\delta \delta E}^{20}$ at $\sim 25\sigma$ and $\sim 15\sigma$, respectively. We also report similar detection significances for the lowest order multipoles of $B_{\delta EE}$ and $B_{EEE}$, although these are largely driven by stochastic contributions. We show that the first and second order EFT parameters are consistent with those obtained from fitting the IA power spectrum analysis at next-to-leading order, without requiring any priors to break degeneracies for the quadratic bias parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of higher multipole moments of $B_{\delta\delta E}$ greatly reduces the errors on second order bias parameters, by factors of 5 or more. The IA bispectrum thus provides an effective means of determining higher order shape bias parameters, thereby characterizing the scale dependence of the IA signal. We also detect parity-odd bispectra such as $B_{\delta \delta B}$ and $B_{\delta EB}$ at $\sim 10 \sigma$ significance or more for $k<0.15\,h$/Mpc and they are fully consistent with the parity-even sector. Furthermore, we check that the Gaussian covariance approximation works reasonably well on the scales we consider here. These results lay the groundwork for using the bispectrum of IA in cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the composition and origin of the inner region of our Galaxy -- the "Galactic bulge" -- is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies. We present new observational constraints based on a sample of around 18,000 stars in the inner Galaxy, combining Gaia DR3 RVS and APOGEE DR17 spectroscopy. Gaia-RVS complements APOGEE by improving sampling of the metallicity, [Fe/H] in the -2.0 to -0.5 dex range. This work marks the first application of Gaia-RVS spectroscopy to the bulge region, enabled by a novel machine learning approach (hybrid-CNN) that derives stellar parameters from intermediate-resolution spectra with precision comparable to APOGEE's infrared data. We performed full orbit integrations using a barred Galactic potential and applied orbital frequency analysis to disentangle the stellar populations in the inner Milky Way. For the first time, traced by the field stars, we are able to robustly identify the long-sought pressure supported bulge. We show this stellar population to be chemically and kinematically distinct from the other main components co-existing in the same region. The spheroidal bulge has a metallicity distribution function (MDF) peak at around -0.70 dex extending to solar value, is dominated by a high-[alpha/Fe] population with almost no dependency on metallicity, consistent with very rapid early formation, predating the thick disc and the bar. We find evidence that the bar has influenced the dynamics of the spheroidal bulge, introducing a mild triaxiality and radial extension. We identify a group of stars on X4 orbits, likely native to the early spheroid, as this population mimics the chemistry of the spheroidal bulge, with a minor contamination from the more metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0) halo. We find the inner-thick disc to be kinematically hotter (mean Vphi ~125 km/s) than the local-thick disc. ...

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube has detected a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos, whose origin still remains uncertain. Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been proposed as plausible sources of neutrinos. Candidate sources include AT2019dsg, which is likely a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), and AT2019dfr, an AGN flare. Both present delayed emission in the IR band with respect to the optical signal. This emission can be interpreted as the reprocessing of X-rays to optical light of the flare by dust located in a torus around the SMBH. An additional study using an optically detected sample of 63 accretion flares revealed another candidate as a potential high-energy neutrino counterpart: AT2019aalc, which is also accompanied by a dust echo. However, follow-up stacking analysis of the 63 nuclear flares using the full IceCube data sample did not show any significant excess over background. Motivated by these three suggested neutrino-TDE correlations, we analyze a more extensive catalog of IR flares, 823 dust-echo-like flares identified using WISE satellite data, against the IceCube 10-year sample of track events from the Northern Sky. Our analysis aims to perform sensitivity studies and assess the potential detectability of neutrino emission from these types of accretion flares. In addition, we carry out a correlation study of the 823 dust echo-like flares against a revised catalog of IceCube high-purity astrophysical alerts, and reevaluate the previous study of 63 nuclear flares against the same revised alerts sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Observing the stars in our night sky tells us that giant, supergiant and hypergiant stars hold an unique importance in the understanding of stellar populations. Theoretical stellar models predict a rich tapestry of evolved stars. These evolved stars result in supernova explosions for massive stars and the shedding of the outer layers of low- and intermediate-mass stars to form white dwarf stars. Stars on these pathways provide elemental and kinematic feedback that shapes their host galaxies and synthesize the elements that we observe in the Universe today. Observational surveys in the Milky Way and the Local Group of galaxies shape our physical understanding of stellar evolution. Hypergiant stars represent stellar evolution at the extremes, displaying evidence of intense stellar winds combined with luminosities and radii that are unrivalled. Supergiant stars are used as elemental beacons in distant galaxies, and supergiants that cross the Cepheid variable instability strip can be used as rulers to measure the scale of our Universe. The overwhelming majority of stars in the Milky Way will become giant stars. Giants are hundreds of times larger and thousands of times more luminous than the Sun, which makes them excellent tracers of stellar structure. In this chapter, I describe the observational and theoretical manifestations of stellar evolution at various stages and masses. I highlight evolutionary connections between evolved products and comment on their eventual endpoints.

 The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V (SDSS-V) is pioneering panoptic spectroscopy: it is the first all-sky, multi-epoch, optical-to-infrared spectroscopic survey. SDSS-V is mapping the sky with multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at telescopes in both hemispheres (the 2.5-m Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory and the 100-inch du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory), where 500 zonal robotic fiber positioners feed light from a wide-field focal plane to an optical (R$\sim 2000$, 500 fibers) and a near-infrared (R$\sim 22,000$, 300 fibers) spectrograph. In addition to these MOS capabilities, the survey is pioneering ultra wide-field ($\sim$ 4000~deg$^2$) integral field spectroscopy enabled by a new dedicated facility (LVM-I) at Las Campanas Observatory, where an integral field spectrograph (IFS) with 1801 lenslet-coupled fibers arranged in a 0.5 degree diameter hexagon feeds multiple R$\sim$4000 optical spectrographs that cover 3600-9800 angstroms. SDSS-V's hardware and multi-year survey strategy are designed to decode the chemo-dynamical history of the Milky Way Galaxy and tackle fundamental open issues in stellar physics in its Milky Way Mapper program, trace the growth physics of supermassive black holes in its Black Hole Mapper program, and understand the self-regulation mechanisms and the chemical enrichment of galactic ecosystems at the energy-injection scale in its Local Volume Mapper program. The survey is well-timed to multiply the scientific output from major all-sky space missions. The SDSS-V MOS programs began robotic operations in 2021; IFS observations began in 2023 with the completion of the LVM-I facility. SDSS-V builds upon decades of heritage of SDSS's pioneering advances in data analysis, collaboration spirit, infrastructure, and product deliverables in astronomy.
#### Ray-tracing Fast Radio Bursts Through IllustrisTNG: Cosmological Dispersion Measures from Redshift 0 to 5.5

 - **Abstract**
 The dispersion measures (DMs) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) arise predominantly from free electrons in the large-scale structure of the Universe. The increasing number of FRB observations have started to empirically constrain the distribution of cosmic baryons, making it crucial to accurately forward model their propagation within cosmological simulations. In this work, we present a method for measuring FRB DMs in IllustrisTNG that continuously traces rays through the simulation while reconstructing all traversed line segments within the underlying Voronoi mesh. Leveraging this technique, we create over $20$ publicly available DM catalogs, including a full-sky DM map observed from a Milky Way-like environment. Our method addresses a problem in previous TNG-based studies, in which a sparse snapshot sampling in the path integral leads to a misestimation of the standard deviation and higher moments of the DM distribution $p(\rm{DM}|z)$ by over $50\%$. We show that our results are consistent with the most recent observational data from the DSA-110, ASKAP, and CHIME. We offer a functional form for $p(\rm{DM}| z)$ that provides very good fits across all redshifts from $0$ to $5.5$, showing that the previously proposed log-normal distribution is not well matched to the data. We find that using simulation box sizes smaller than $35\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc or resolutions with baryonic masses of less than $5\times10^{8}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ can distort the derived DM signal by more than $8\%$. Our findings provide new insights into how the cosmic web shapes FRB signals, and highlight the importance of accurate methodology when comparing cosmological simulations against observations.
