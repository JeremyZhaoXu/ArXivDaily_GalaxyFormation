#### Little Red Dots Are Nurseries of Massive Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at $z \sim 5$, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). With effective radii of $\sim 100$ pc and stellar masses of $10^9-10^{11} \, \rm M_\odot$, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, $\rho_\star\sim10^4-10^5 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$ and in some cases up to $\sim 10^9 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for $10 \, \rm M_\odot$ stars in the central $0.1$ pc is $< 0.1$ Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass $9\times10^3 < M_{\rm VMS} \, [\rm M_\odot] < 5\times10^4$ within $<1$ Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a $\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_\bullet \sim 10^4 \, \rm M_\odot$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the origin of intervening cool MgII absorption detected in the spectra of background quasars and the nature of associated galaxies across a broad redshift range of $0.3 \le z \le 1.6$. Using nebular [O II] $\lambda\lambda$3727,3729 emission lines identified in DESI fiber spectra centered on quasar, we detect 377 galaxies at a typical detection rate of $\sim$0.45% at $z \lesssim 1$, which increases with MgII equivalent width ($W_{2796}$). A significant fraction (74%) of these galaxies are associated with strong absorbers with $W_{2796} \ge$ 2Å. These absorbers trace galaxies spanning stellar masses of $\rm 8.4 \le \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \le 11.6$ and star formation rates (SFRs) of $\rm -1.2 \le log(SFR~[M_{\odot}yr^{-1}]) \le 2.7$, located at projected galactocentric distances of 4-24 kpc. We find the average MgII absorber strength increases from 2.1Å to 2.9Å between redshifts $z \sim$ 0.4 and 1.2, indicating evolution in the cool gas content of galaxy halos. The relatively constant absorber strength with galactocentric distance implies a clumpy structure of cool gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Further, we find a positive correlation between $W_{2796}$ versus $M_\star$, and SFR, suggesting that the distribution of metal-enriched cool gas in the CGM is closely tied to the properties of the host galaxies. The redshift evolution of gas-phase metallicity suggests that strong MgII absorbers trace the general population of star-forming galaxies. The velocity dispersion of the cool gas increases with halo mass, and the wide range of line of sight velocity offset (-389 to 364 $\rm km\ s^{-1}$) between the galaxy systemic velocity and absorbers highlights the dynamical nature of CGM. However, the majority of this gas remains gravitationally bound to the dark matter halos, consistent with a picture of gas recycling via galactic fountains.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) host complex stellar populations whose chemical signatures imply early retention and reprocessing of stellar ejecta, yet direct evidence for intracluster gas is lacking. Here we present a unified theoretical framework for the accumulation, fate, and eventual removal of gas released by evolved stars in young GCs, and their implications for the production of multiple stellar populations. Using MIST stellar evolution tracks, we show that low-velocity (< 20 km/s) AGB winds, each released over 10^4 yr, are gravitationally retained in >10^5 MSun clusters. In addition, AGB winds in such clusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering a rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions, mapped across cluster initial mass and size, agree well with the observed second population fractions in Milky Way GCs. We then show that the accumulated gas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by encounters with pre-existing stars over 1 - 10 kyr. Instead, the gas is accreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Bondi-Hoyle accretion and time-dependent core-halo models indicate that both white dwarfs and neutron stars can grow and collapse within a few 100 Myr, and that lower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range required to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the multiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the second-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population stars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed retained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes will clear the gas by 10^9 yr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for present-day clusters.
#### Explosive Dispersal Outflows as a New Class of Fermi Gamma-Ray Sources: The Case of DR21

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission from an explosive dispersal outflow in the Milky Way, revealing a new source class of high-energy emission. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.2 $-$ 500 GeV range, we detect a significant ($ > 35\sigma $) $\gamma$-ray emission spatially coincident with the DR21 outflow, located at a distance of 1.5 kpc in the Cygnus-X star-forming region. The spectrum follows a power-law plus an exponential cutoff model with a spectral index $\Gamma = 2.08\pm0.02$ and $E_{\rm c} = 10089 \pm 2963$~MeV, integrating which we estimate a total $\gamma$-ray luminosity $L_{\gamma} \simeq (2.17\pm 0.15) \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the $0.1-500$ GeV band. This $\gamma$-ray emission is spatially coincident with additional multiwavelength data, including allWISE mid-IR and regions of dense gas. By comparing the observed $\gamma$-ray luminosity to the estimated kinetic energy of the outflow inferred from prior studies of DR21, we find that $\leq 15\%$ of the kinetic power of the outflow goes into particle acceleration. Our findings demonstrate that explosive dispersal outflows can contribute significantly to the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background of the Galaxy, highlighting their importance as particle accelerators in star-forming environments.
#### The Interstellar Medium in I Zw 18 seen with JWST/MIRI: II. Warm Molecular Hydrogen and Warm Dust

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/MIRI spectra from the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of IZw18, a nearby dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of $\sim 3$% Solar. Here, we investigate warm molecular hydrogen, H2, observed in spectra extracted in $\sim 120$ pc apertures centered on eleven regions of interest. We detect 7 H2 rotational lines, some of which are among the weakest ever measured. The H2 population diagrams are fit with local-thermodynamic-equilibrium models and models of photodissociation regions. We also fit the ortho-/para-H2 ratios (OPRs); in three of the six regions for which it was possible to fit the OPR, we find values significantly greater than 3, the maximum value for local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, although predicted theoretically, this is the first time that OPR significantly $> 3$ has been measured in interstellar gas. We find that OPR tends to increase with decreasing H2 column density, consistent with the expected effects of self-shielding in advancing photodissociation fronts. The population diagrams are consistent with H nucleon densities of $\sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, and an interstellar radiation field scaling factor, G0, of $\sim 10^3$. This warm, dense H2 gas co-exists with the same highly ionized gas that emits [OIV] and [NeV]. Emission from T $\geq 50$K dust is detected, including an as-yet unidentified dust emission feature near 14 $\mu$m; possible identification as Al$_2$O$_3$ is discussed. The continuum emission from several regions requires that a considerable fraction of the refractory elements be incorporated in dust. Despite stacking spectra in the SE where H2 is found, no significant emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is detected.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's (MW's) star formation history (SFH) offers insight into the chronology of its assembly and the mechanisms driving its structural development. In this study, we present an inference and analysis of the spatially resolved SFH and the MW disc growth. Our approach leverages both stellar birth radii estimates and the complete reconstruction of the MW stellar disc using a novel orbit superposition method from APOGEE data, allowing us to trace the orbit-mass weighted SFH based on formation sites while taking into account stellar mass loss. We find that the MW is a typical disc galaxy exhibiting inside-out formation: it was compact at $z > 2$ ($\rm R_{\rm eff} \approx 2$ kpc), had a peak in its star formation rate (SFR) 9--10 Gyr ago, and grew to a present-day size of $\rm R_{\rm eff} \approx 4.3$ kpc. A secondary peak in SFR $\sim 4$ Gyr ago is responsible for the onset of the outer disc, which comprises the metal-poor, low-$\alpha$ population. We find that in-situ star formation in the solar neighbourhood started 8--9 Gyr ago. The MW disc is characterised by a negative mean age gradient, as the result of the inside-out growth, with additional flattening induced by stellar radial migration. Our work showcases the importance of accounting for radial migration and stellar sample selection function when inferring the SFH and build-up of the MW disc.

 - **Abstract**
 We exploit the most robust, old, and cosmology-independent age estimates of individual stars from Gaia DR3 to place a lower bound on the age of the Universe, $t_U$. These constraints can serve as an anchor point for any cosmological model, providing an upper limit to the Hubble constant $H_0$. We consider the stellar age catalog of arXiv:2402.00561, selecting 3,000 of the oldest and most robustly measured main sequence turn-off (MSTO) and subgiant branch (SGB) stars, with ages $>12.5$ Gyr and associated error $<1$ Gyr. Ages are derived via isochrone fitting using the Bayesian code StarHorse, spanning the uniform range 0-20 Gyr, not assuming any cosmological prior on $t_U$. With a conservative cut in the Kiel diagram, strict quality cuts both on stellar parameters and posterior shapes, and removing potential contaminants, we isolate a final sample of 160 bona-fide stars, representing the largest sample of precise and reliable MSTO and SGB stars ages available to date. The age distribution of the final sample peaks at $13.6 \pm 1.0$ (stat) $\pm 1.3$ (syst) Gyr. Assuming a maximum formation redshift for these stars of $z_f = 20$ (a formation delay of $\sim$0.2 Gyr), we obtain a lower bound on $t_U$ of $t_U \geq 13.8 \pm 1.0$ (stat) $\pm 1.3$ (syst) Gyr. Considering the $10^{th}$ percentile of each star's posterior distributions, we find that, at 90% CL (stat), 70 stars favour $t_U > 13$ Gyr, while none exceeds 14.1 Gyr. An oldest age younger than 13 Gyr for this sample is incompatible with the data, even considering the full systematic error budget. This work presents the first statistically significant use of individual stellar ages as cosmic clocks, opening a new, independent approach for cosmological studies. While this already represents a major step forward, future Gaia data releases will yield even larger and more precise stellar samples, further strengthening these constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial non-Gaussianities (PNGs) are features in the initial density field that provide a window into the nonlinear dynamics of particles during the inflationary epoch. Among them, a distinctive set of signatures from "cosmological collider physics" originates through interactions of the inflaton with heavy particles active at high energies. The amplitude and form of these signatures depend on the strength and nature of the interactions. The corresponding features in large-scale structure have been studied predominantly through the use of perturbation theory, restricted to the linear regime of the density field. In this work, we implement a method for running cosmological simulations with arbitrary bispectra signals in their initial density field, and produce a simulation suite of over thirty PNG-generating templates, resolving the corresponding collider signatures in the strongly nonlinear regime of the density field. We detail the signals in a variety of late-time measurements -- the matter power spectra, matter bispectra, the halo abundance, and halo bias. We then forecast the potential constraints on the signal amplitudes using weak lensing measurements from the Year-10 dataset of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The second and third moments of the lensing convergence field produce constraints that are competitive and complementary to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background. The data products are publicly released as part of the Ulagam simulation suite. Our initial conditions generator is also publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution has seen a theoretical resurgence in the past decade, but significant uncertainties remain in CR transport through the interstellar and circum-galactic media (ISM and CGM). While several works indicate CR effects may be notable in both star-forming and quenched massive galaxies, modeling the vast CR transport parameter space currently allowed by observations is computationally restrictive to survey. Analytic treatments of CR feedback have provided useful insights to potential ramifications in different regimes, but have relied on time-steady assumptions which may not well characterize CR effects at different cosmic epochs and galaxy mass scales. We present semi-analytic and numerical solutions describing the time-dependent evolution of CR pressure in the CGM under simplified assumptions, which allow for quick evaluation of the vast allowable CR transport parameter space. We demonstrate that time-dependent injection from bursty star formation and/or episodic black hole accretion can substantially alter CR pressure profiles, particularly in the outer halos of massive galaxies ($\gtrsim R_{vir}$). Our work further suggests that CR feedback may play a significant role in shaping the matter distribution around massive galaxies ($\gtrsim M_{\textrm{halo}} \sim 10^{13} M_\odot$), and we speculate that these time-dependent effects may connect to observed phenomena like ``Odd Radio Circles". Finally, we benchmark our semi-analytic formalism against a cosmic ray-magnetohydrodynamic (CR-MHD) cosmological zoom-in galaxy simulation directly modeling the CR scattering rate and emergent transport in full generality, highlighting the validity of our approach. We conclude by motivating careful consideration of time-dependent ``softening" effects in sub-grid routines for CR feedback, particularly for use in large cosmological volumes.
#### Hierarchical assembly impedes the inference of stellar mass growth histories for individual galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Some massive, quiescent galaxies at z>3 appear to contain considerable numbers of old stars (forming at z>7). Works inferring the star formation histories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that the assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the well-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else indicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these studies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of observation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models like CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller galaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of stars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use the TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy masses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs. I demonstrate that the assumption of in-situ stellar mass assembly can lead to significant biases in inferred stellar mass histories, with historic (i.e. looking back from the epoch of observation) stellar masses overestimated by over an order of magnitude in some cases. The bias increases with increasing halo mass, for inferences made further from the epoch of observation, and with decreasing descendant galaxy redshift. I derive corrections that can be applied to inferred stellar mass histories for more robust comparisons with dark matter halo mass functions at high redshift.
#### Impact of Uncertainties in Spectral Energy Distribution Modelling on Inferred Galaxy Properties

 - **Abstract**
 Interpreting galaxy properties from astronomical surveys relies heavily on spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling, yet uncertainties in key model ingredients are often overlooked. By leveraging a $z\sim0$ galaxy sample from the EAGLE simulation, we generate synthetic SDSS spectral and VISTA photometric observations with controlled assumptions, to assess how variations in stellar spectral library, initial mass function (IMF) and metallicity prescriptions within the BPASS-framework affect inferred galaxy properties. Our analysis combines spectral fitting from 3800 to 9200 A with photometric constraints extending to 2.3 $\mu$m, enabling robust assessment across a broad wavelength baseline. Our findings reveal mass, age and star formation rate vary by $0.27\pm0.09$, $0.19\pm0.11$ and $1.4\pm1.0$ dex, respectively, greater than observational uncertainties reported in surveys. Notably, we find stellar spectral library choice is capable of transforming a galaxy from appearing star-forming to quiescent, while a fixed metallicity assumption yields systematic biases when the chosen metallicity is incorrect. These modelling differences impact the reconstructed total mass assembly history in galaxies by up to $\sim12$ percent and bias the demographic and star formation history conclusions drawn from surveys. As upcoming missions like Euclid, Roman and CASTOR aim to characterise galaxy evolution with unprecedented precision, our results highlight the need for careful propagation of SED modelling uncertainties and transparency in model selection.
#### The role of peculiar velocity uncertainties in standard siren cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 Local distance indicators such as standard sirens, in combination with spectroscopic redshift measurements of their host galaxies, allow us to estimate the present-day expansion rate of the Universe parameterised by Hubble's constant, H_0. However, these observed redshifts are systematically modified by the effect of galaxy peculiar velocities. Although these velocities may be estimated from the local density field by the process of velocity-field reconstruction, the intrinsic errors and covariance in these estimates contribute to the error in the H_0 determination. In this paper we demonstrate how the impact of peculiar velocities can be propagated into H_0 measurements from local distance indicators with observed redshifts, incorporating the full covariance of the velocity field induced by bulk flows. We apply our methods to cosmological simulations, testing the importance of this effect in the context of future analyses of gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts used as bright sirens. We conclude that H_0 errors may be increased by up to a factor of 2 in comparison with neglecting peculiar velocity covariance, with the highest impacts expected for sources at nearby distances or with small distance errors. Our analytical methods may also be applied to other local distance indicators, such as Type Ia supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. RR Lyrae stars are key distance indicators and tracers of old stellar populations in the Milky Way and its satellites. Accurate period and amplitude measurements are essential for constraining stellar evolution and mapping Galactic structure. The Javalambre VARiability (J-VAR) survey provides valuable time-series data across seven optical bands, including gri and four medium and narrow bands. Aims. Our goal is to construct and analyze light curves for RR Lyrae stars identified in the first data release (DR1) of the J-VAR survey using the Gaia DR3 variable stars catalog as a reference. Methods. The light curves of 315 RR Lyrae were analyzed by fitting templates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multiband template library. The periods and amplitudes for the seven bands in J-VAR were independently obtained from the best-fitted templates. Results. The J-VAR periods show strong agreement with Gaia DR3 values, which confirms the reliability of the applied methodology. The Bailey diagram for each J-VAR filter reveals the expected trend for RRab and RRc stars, with larger pulsation amplitudes at bluer wavelengths. After normalizing by the r-band amplitude, an exponential trend is found, with the bluer J-VAR filter centered at 395 nm having twice the amplitude of the reddest J-VAR passband at 861 nm. The normalized amplitudes of the RR Lyrae stars from Gaia and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) are consistent with the J-VAR trend. Finally, the SDSS templates derived from broadbands also provide a proper description for the medium and narrow band light curves. Conclusions. The J-VAR RR Lyrae catalog offers reliable pulsation parameters and light curves in seven optical filters, allowing the systematic study of amplitude trends from 395 to 860 nm and offering a unique benchmark for theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the observation of extended stellar cores in dark matter (DM) dominated dwarf galaxies, this study investigates a simple mechanism by which stellar cores can form as a result of DM halo expansion. Several non-CDM models predict that the DM distribution thermalizes over time, transforming initially cuspy halos into cores. This transformation weakens the gravitational potential, allowing the stellar component to expand and form diffuse, core-like structures. Using analytical models and adiabatic invariants, we examine stellar systems with purely tangential, purely radial, and isotropic orbits evolving under a slowly changing potential. Across a wide range of initial and final conditions, we find that stellar cores form relatively easily, though their properties depend sensitively on these conditions. Orbit types preserve their nature during the DM halo expansion: tangential and radial orbits remain so, while isotropic orbits remain nearly isotropic in the central regions. Systems with circular orbits develop stellar cores when the initial stellar density logarithmic slope lies between -0.5 and -1.2, whereas radial systems do not form cores. Isotropic systems behave similarly to tangential ones, producing cores that are isotropic in the center but develop increasing radial anisotropy outward; the anisotropy parameter "beta" grows from sim 0.07 at the core radius to sim 0.5 at three core radii. The theoretical and observational literature suggests initial DM profiles with steep slopes and stellar distributions that are shallower and isotropic at the center. Given these conditions, the mechanism predicts stellar cores with radii at least 40 % that of the DM core and inner logarithmic slopes shallower than 0.6.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the scenarios for bar formation in galaxies involves their interaction with a more massive companion. The stellar component is then transformed from a disk into a bar-like prolate spheroid. I investigated a subsample of 77 bar-like galaxies tidally induced in the cluster environment, selected among the previously studied sample of bar-like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations. I present six clear, convincing examples of bar-like galaxies formed after an interaction with a progenitor of a massive brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and describe the properties of their bars. For the whole sample, the time of bar formation is strongly correlated with and typically slightly greater than the time of the pericenter passage. All galaxies are strongly stripped of dark matter and gas, and their rotation is similarly diminished. A larger pericenter distance typically requires a higher host mass in order to transform the galaxy, but the interactions show no preference for prograde configurations. The final strength of the bars does not correlate with the amount of tidal stripping experienced because of the variety of initial properties of the progenitors and the subsequent evolution over the next pericenter passages. In spite of difficulties in the interpretation of some cases involving mergers and multiple interactions, the results confirm in the cosmological context the reality of tidal bar formation in cluster environments previously studied using controlled simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission is produced by the interaction of high-energy cosmic rays propagating through the Milky Way with interstellar gas and radiation fields. Its measurement can provide crucial insights into the acceleration and transport of cosmic rays throughout our Galaxy. Here, we present a new analysis of the TeV Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission using 8 years of HAWC data. This data was processed with the updated Pass 5 processing, enhancing the sensitivity and resolution of the instrument. For the analysis, we make use of Gammapy, an open-source package for gamma-ray astronomy, and recent models of the Galactic diffuse emission at TeV energies. After subtracting the emission from sources using an algorithm akin to that developed for the foreseen CTAO Galactic plane survey, we find significant remaining emission throughout the Galactic plane. We show the latitudinal and longitudinal flux profiles of the emission in multiple parts of the galaxy taking into account various sources of uncertainty and compare to existing models. We find significant emission beyond 3 degree latitude, consistent in shape with the prediction for the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar gas. We also demonstrate that our results are consistent with recent LHAASO results when equivalent analysis methods are used.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark-matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $z \approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of `little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The real nature of little red dots (LRDs), a class of very compact galaxies in the early Universe recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, is still poorly understood. The most popular theories competing to interpret the phenomena include active galactic nuclei and enhanced star formation in dusty galaxies. To date, however, neither model gives a completely satisfactory explanation to the population as a whole; thus, alternative theories have arisen, including tidal disruption events (TDEs). By considering observational constraints on the radio emission of LRDs, we discuss whether TDEs are adequate alternatives solving these high-redshift enigmas. We utilise radio flux density upper limits from LRD stacking analyses, TDE peak radio luminosities, and volumetric density estimates. We find that the characteristic values of flux densities and luminosities allow radio-quiet TDEs as the underlying process of LRDs in any case, while the less common radio-loud TDEs are compatible with the model under special constraints only. Considering other factors, such as volumetric density estimates, delayed and long-term radio flares of TDEs, and cosmological time dilation, TDEs appear to be a plausible explanation for LRDs from the radio point of view.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs), detectable via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offer a novel avenue to constrain dark energy. Based on cosmological simulations and semi-analytic galaxy formation models, this study explores the detectability of individual nanohertz SMBBH sources using next-generation PTAs and their potential for constraining dark energy under an optimistic scenario considering only the presence of white noise. By constructing light-cone SMBBH populations across hardening timescales ($\tau_H = 0.1/5/10$Gyr) and computing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), we find advanced PTAs can resolve $10^2$--$10^3$ sources with SNR $> 8$ (primarily at $z < 1$ with chirp masses of $10^8$--$10^{10}M_{\odot}$). If electromagnetic counterparts can be identified, optimal configurations ($\sigma_t = 50$ns, $N_p = 1000$, $T_{\text{obs}} = 30$yr with$ \tau_H \leq 5$Gyr) could constrain the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w$ to $\Delta w \sim 0.023$--$0.048$, where the constraints only exhibit weak dependence on $\tau_H$ within $0.1$--$5$Gyr. If only $10\%$ of GW sources have detectable electromagnetic counterparts, constraints weaken to $\Delta w = 0.075$ ($\tau_H = 0.1$Gyr) and $\Delta w = 0.162$ ($\tau_H = 5$Gyr) under the most optimal parameter configuration. What's more, conservative PTAs ($N_p = 500$, $\sigma_t = 100$--$200$ns) with additional $30$-year data accumulation could double resolvable source counts and improve $\Delta w$ precision by $\sim 40\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a reanalysis of the metallicity of the double red clump (RC) stars from the Milky Way bulge. Two leading explanations for the existence of the double RC concern possible differences in chemical composition (multiple populations of stars) or distance (X-shaped bulge). We aim to verify the chemical composition hypothesis by determining the mean metallicity of each RC. We use infrared photometric data and metallicities from a previous study (that are based on the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System spectra). In contrast with previous studies, we assign stars to RCs or the red giant branch using a Bayesian approach. Our resulting difference between mean metallicity of the two RCs equals: $0.23^{+0.19}_{-0.24}$ or $0.28^{+0.17}_{-0.18}~\mathrm{dex}$, if the red giant branch bump is included or not, respectively. Because of the high statistical error, the result does not confirm the multiple populations hypothesis.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We derive the stellar mass function (SMF) of quiescent and star-forming galaxies at z <= 0.2 using 12-band optical photometry from the third data release (DR3) of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) over 3,284 deg^2. Methods. We select approximately 890,000 galaxies with r <= 20 mag and photometric redshifts in the range 0.05 <= z <= 0.20. Stellar masses and star formation rates were derived through spectral energy distribution fitting with CIGALE, confronted with spectroscopic samples. Galaxies are classified as star-forming or quiescent based on their specific star formation rate (sSFR), adopting log(sSFR [yr^-1]) = -10.2. We compute SMFs for both populations using the 1/Vmax method, apply completeness corrections, and fit Schechter functions. Results. The SMFs from J-PLUS DR3 are well described by Schechter functions and agree with previous photometric and spectroscopic studies. The characteristic mass for quiescent galaxies, log(M*/Msun) = 10.80, is 0.4 dex larger than that of star-forming galaxies. The faint-end slope is steeper for star-forming galaxies (alpha = -1.2) than for quiescent ones (alpha = -0.7). The quiescent fraction rises by 40 percent per dex in stellar mass, reaching fQ > 0.95 at log(M*/Msun) > 11. Comparisons with the GAEA semi-analytic model reveal an excess of star-forming galaxies at intermediate masses. Conclusions. J-PLUS DR3 stellar mass functions and quiescent fractions are consistent with the literature and provide robust constraints for galaxy formation models. Quiescent galaxies represent 45 percent of number density above log(M*) > 9, but 75 percent of stellar mass density. The use of 12 optical bands, including 7 narrow filters, improves redshift precision by 20 percent, enabling more accurate SED fitting and galaxy classification.
#### Beyond the Clouds: S3 as the most distant extended Milky Way stream, not of LMC origin

 - **Abstract**
 Context: While the LMC's influence on MW stellar streams has been extensively studied, streams associated with the Clouds have received far less attention. Beyond the Magellanic Stream, only four stream candidates (S1-S4) have been reported. Aims: We focus on the S3 stream, a long ($\sim30^\circ$) and narrow ($\sim1.2^\circ$) structure at 60-80 kpc, nearly aligned with the LMC. Our goals are: 1) to validate the stream through a kinematic analysis of S3 candidates with Gaia DR3 data; 2) to enlarge the sample of potential members; and 3) to model the stream in order to test its association with either the MW or the LMC. Methods: We selected new S3 candidates with a neural network classifier trained on Gaia DR3 data, and further reduced contamination through a cut in the proper-motion space. To investigate the origin of S3, we evolve stream models within time-dependent, deforming MW and LMC haloes, thereby accounting for possible effects of the MW-LMC interaction. Results: We identify 1,542 high-confidence new S3 stream candidates and find that the stream's apparent width has grown from $\sim1.2^\circ$ to $\sim3$-$4^\circ$ compared to previous studies. We also present a list of 440 potential S3 red clump stars, which are valuable targets for spectroscopic follow-up thanks to their well-defined luminosities and ability to yield precise distances. Both modelling and a comparison of S3 stars' closest approach distance and velocity with the LMC's escape velocity indicate that S3 is unlikely to originate from the LMC, instead representing a distant ($\sim75$ kpc) MW stream. Conclusions: S3 is the most distant ($\sim75$ kpc) extended ($\sim30^\circ$ long, $\sim3$-$4^\circ$ thick) MW stream known, offering a unique probe of the outer halo and the LMC's recent influence. Its angular width corresponds to a physical thickness of $\sim4$-5 kpc, making S3 among the thickest streams discovered.
