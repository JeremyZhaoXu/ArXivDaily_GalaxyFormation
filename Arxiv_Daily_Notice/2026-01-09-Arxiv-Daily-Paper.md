#### Morphologies arising from the gas flow in the innermost kiloparsec of barred galaxy models

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We study a series of response models to investigate the formation of specific morphological features in the central 1 kpc region of the gas component in barred spiral galaxies. Aims. We aim to understand how structures, such as nuclear rings and spirals, form by varying the parameters of a general gravitational potential and gas properties. Our goal is to determine how much the shape of these structures is driven by the orbital dynamics of the models compared to the influence of the hydrodynamics of the gas. In particular, we examine the effects of the bar strength, bar shape, pattern speed, and central density, as well as their mutual interdependence. Methods. We modeled the gas flow using hydrodynamical simulations run with the Eulerian RAMSES code. The underlying gravitational potential was a two-dimensional Ferrers bar and the gas was considered to be isothermal. Alongside analyzing the gas response to the imposed gravitational potentials, we carried out orbital studies for all models. This involved assessing the shapes and stability of periodic orbits and analyzing the distribution of regular versus chaotic regions within the systems. Results. The parameters of the gravitational potential alone are insufficient to accurately predict the gas dynamics in a system. The morphology of the gaseous response varies substantially with changes in sound speed, emphasizing the fundamental role of hydrodynamic processes in determining the structure of the gas within the central region. We identify the factors that affect the morphology of nuclear rings and trailing and leading nuclear spirals. The best alignment between our models and structures observed in local barred galaxies is achieved by assuming a sound speed of $c_s=20\,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way represent an archetypal case of galactic nucleus feedback, yet their origin remains highly debated. Here we use hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of the "Fermi bubbles" in the nearby Circinus galaxy, a pair of kpc-scaled elliptical bubbles seen in both radio and X-ray observations. We find that a pair of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets drive forward shocks in the circumgalactic medium, and after evolving for ~0.95 Myr, the shock-delineated bubble pair roughly matches the observed Circinus bubbles in size and morphology. Our mock X-ray image and spectrum reproduce the observed edge-brightened X-ray surface brightness distribution and spectrum quite well, and suggest that non-thermal emissions from the jet ejecta also contribute substantially to radio and X-ray emissions from the inner "hotspot" region. We further show that AGN winds tend to produce more spherical bubbles with a wider base near the galactic plane, inconsistent with observations. The hotspot emissions and the misalignment between the galaxy rotational axis and the bubble's axis argue against a starburst wind origin. Our study thus corroborates the AGN jet-shock model for the origin of both the Circinus bubbles and the Fermi bubbles, and suggests that AGN jet feedback may be a common origin of extended gaseous bubbles in regular disk galaxies, potentially playing an important role in their evolution.
#### Nitrogen enhancement of GN-z11 by metal pollution from supermassive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed young, compact, high-redshift ($z$) galaxies with high nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios. GN-z11 at z=10.6 is one of these galaxies. One possible scenario for such a high N/O ratio is pollution from supermassive stars (SMSs), from which stellar winds are expected to be nitrogen-rich. The abundance pattern is determined by both galaxy evolution and SMS pollution, but so far, simple one-zone models have been used. Using a galaxy formation simulation, we tested the SMS scenario. We used a cosmological zoom-in simulation that includes chemical evolution driven by rotating massive stars (Wolf-Rayet stars), supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. As a post-process, we assumed the formation of an SMS with a mass between $10^3$ and $10^5$ $M_\odot$ and investigated the contribution of its ejecta to the abundance pattern. The N/O ratio was enhanced by the SMS ejecta, and the abundance pattern of GN-z11, including carbon-to-oxygen and oxygen-to-hydrogen ratios, was reproduced by our SMS pollution model if the pollution mass fraction ranges within 10-30 per cent. Such a pollution fraction can be realized when the gas ionized by the SMS is polluted, and the gas density is $10^4$-$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ assuming a Strömgren sphere. We also compared the abundance pattern with those of other N/O-enhanced high-$z$ galaxies. Some of these galaxies can also be explained by SMS pollution.
#### Can tidal disruption event models reliably measure black hole masses?

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption event (TDE) light curves are increasingly used to infer the masses of quiescent supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm{BH}}$), offering a powerful probe of low-mass black hole demographics independent of host-galaxy scaling relations. However, the reliability of most semi-analytic TDE models assume full stellar disruption, despite theoretical expectations that partial disruptions dominate the TDE population. In this work we test the robustness of current TDE models using three repeating partial TDEs (rpTDEs), in which the multiple flares produced by the same surviving stellar core must yield consistent black hole masses. We present spectroscopic observations establishing AT 2023adr as a rpTDE, making it the third such spectroscopically confirmed event. We independently model the flares of the three rpTDEs; 2020vdq, 2022dbl, and 2023adr, applying fallback-accretion fits, stream-stream collision scaling relations, luminosity-based empirical relations, and cooling-envelope fits. After accounting for statistical and model-specific systematics, we find that all TDE models generally return self-consistent $M_{\rm{BH}}$ values between flares, and are broadly consistent with host-galaxy $M_{\rm{BH}}$ proxies, recovering $M_{\rm{BH}}$ to within 0.3-0.5 dex. However, the convergence of fallback models towards unphysical stellar masses and impact parameters reveals limitations in the existing fallback model grids. We also show that light curve coverage, particularly in the near-UV, is critical for constraining model parameters. This has direct implications for interpreting the thousands of TDE light curves expected from upcoming surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, where from simulations, we find that $M_{\rm{BH}}$ may be underestimated on average by 0.5 dex without additional follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 In this pilot study, we investigate the PN population in M~33, a nearby spiral galaxy ($\simeq 840$~kpc), using data from the DR3 of the Javalambre-Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS), a 12-band photometric dataset extensively used to identify H$\alpha$ line emitters. From the 143 known PNe of M~33, the photometry of only 13 are present in the J-PLUS catalog, as available on the J-PLUS portal. With the aim of recovering a larger fraction of the M~33 PN population, the software SExtractor is adopted to extract the sources in the J-PLUS images and obtain the photometric data for the PNe known in the literature, performing PSF photometry when possible. With this procedure the photometry of 98 PNe was obtained using H$\alpha$ image as detection image, including the 13 already present in the J-PLUS catalog. Using diagnostic color-color diagrams (DCCDs) based on criteria developed for Milky Way halo PNe, we identified 16 sources with PN-like colors. Cross-match with existing catalogs revealed that most of these candidates are H II regions, though one source remains unidentified. Additionally, analyzing their full width at half maximum, most of them would not be PN candidates. This highlights the method's ability to select emission-line objects but also underscores the challenge of distinguishing PNe from contaminants using photometry alone. The J-PLUS colors of 98 known PNe were analyzed, together with literature information on their radial velocities, resulting in the identification of one possible halo PN. This is the first paper which aims at detecting extragalactic PNe in multi-band surveys such as J-PLUS, the Southern Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) and the Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS), paving the way for similar studies in these surveys for other nearby galaxies, which lack catalogs of known PNe.

 - **Abstract**
 The absolute calibration of period-luminosity (PL) relations of Cepheids in the Milky Way (MW) and its nearby galaxies has been a cornerstone in determining extragalactic distances and the current local expansion rate of the Universe. However, the universality of PL relations is still debated; particularly, the metallicity effect on the Cepheid PL relation. Due to the HIF-stellar photosphere interactions in Cepheids, different period-color (PC) relations at different phases can influence the corresponding PL relations at those this http URL have considered the PL relations at multiple pulsation phases as they capture the ensemble radiation hydrodynamic properties at those phases. We investigate the effect of metallicity on PL relations based on multiphase analysis of classical Cepheid light curves in the MW, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Multiphase metallicity coefficients $(\gamma)$ are derived in five different photometric bands ($V$, $I$, $G$, $G_{\rm BP}$, $G_{\rm RP}$) and two Wesenheit indices ($W_{VI}$, $W_{G}$). We show that the coefficients of multiphase period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations vary dynamically as functions of Cepheid pulsation phases over a complete pulsation cycle. We find significant differences in the $\gamma_{\lambda}$ values between the short- $(0.4 \leq \log{P} < 1)$ and long-period $(1 \leq \log{P} < 2)$ Cepheids at multiple phases, in two bands, $G_{\rm RP}$ and $W_{G}$. The weighted averages of the multiphase $\gamma_{\lambda}$ values are found to be in good agreement with the latest results published in the literature. Our methods and results provide new insights into the metallicity effect on the Leavitt law, which can be useful in constraining pulsation models. Additionally, this study shows that the metallicity effect on mean-light PL relations can be recovered from its phase-dependent nature found in this study.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.

 - **Abstract**
 We establish a general, void-based consistency test for Galileon scalar-tensor theories. We show that the previously reported unphysical breakdown of the predicted Newtonian force in certain Galileon models is controlled by a single condition linking non-linear void dynamics to the cosmic expansion history. This connection yields a redshift-dependent upper bound on the allowed depth of voids and promotes this requirement to a new viability condition, complementary to standard stability criteria. As an example, we apply this void-based criterion to a linear parameterization in the scale factor constrained by theoretical and observational bounds; we find that $\sim 60\%$ of the parameter space is excluded, with most problematic models failing by $z\lesssim 10$. These results position cosmic voids as sharp, broadly applicable, theory-informed filters for viable modified gravity, enabling more informed priors and parameter-space choices in future cosmological inference.

 - **Abstract**
 The structure of dark matter haloes is often described by radial density profiles motivated by cosmological simulations. These are typically assumed to have a fixed functional form (e.g. NFW), with some free parameters that can be constrained with observations. However, relying on simulations has the disadvantage that the resulting profiles depend on the dark matter model and the baryonic physics implementation, which are highly uncertain. Instead, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations. This is done using a symbolic regression algorithm called Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR). ESR searches for the optimal analytic expression to fit data, combining both accuracy and simplicity. We apply ESR to a sample of 149 galaxy clusters from the HSC-XXL survey to identify which functional forms perform best across the entire sample of clusters. We identify density profiles that statistically outperform NFW under a minimum-description-length criterion. Within the radial range probed by the weak-lensing data ($R \sim 0.3 - 3$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc), the highest-ranked ESR profiles exhibit shallow inner behaviour and a maximum in the density profile. As a practical application, we show how the best-fitting ESR models can be used to obtain enclosed mass estimates. We find masses that are, on average, higher than those derived using NFW, highlighting a source of potential bias when assuming the wrong density profile. These results have important knock-on effects for analyses that utilise clusters, for example cosmological constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ from cluster abundance and clustering. Beyond the HSC dataset, the method is readily applicable to any data constraining the dark matter distribution in galaxies and galaxy clusters, such as other weak lensing surveys, galactic rotation curves, or complementary probes.
#### Mitigating Simulator Dependence in AI Parameter Inference for the Epoch of Reionization: The Importance of Simulation Diversity

 - **Abstract**
 The 21cm signal of neutral hydrogen contains a wealth of information about the poorly constrained era of cosmological history, the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Recently, AI models trained on EoR simulations have gained significant attention as a powerful and flexible option for inferring parameters from 21cm observations. However, previous works show that AI models trained on data from one simulator fail to generalize to data from another, raising doubts about AI models' ability to accurately infer parameters from observation. We develop a new strategy for training AI models on cosmological simulations based on the principle that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves model robustness by averaging out spurious and contradictory information. We train AI models on data from different combinations of four simulators, then compare the models' performance when predicting on data from held-out simulators acting as proxies for the real universe. We find that models trained on data from multiple simulators perform better on data from a held-out simulator than models trained on data from a single simulator, indicating that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves a model's ability to generalize. This result suggests that future EoR parameter inference methods can mitigate simulator-specific bias by incorporating multiple simulation approaches into their analyses.
