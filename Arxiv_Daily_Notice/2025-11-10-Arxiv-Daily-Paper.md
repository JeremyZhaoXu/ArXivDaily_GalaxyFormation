 - **Abstract**
 The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with mass $M_\bullet > 10^9 \, \rm M_\odot$ hosted by high-redshift galaxies have challenged our understanding of black hole formation and growth, as several pathways have emerged attempting to explain their existence. The "heavy-seed" pathway eases the problem with the progenitors of these SMBHs having birth masses up to ${\sim} 10^5~{\rm M_\odot}$. Here, we investigate the possibility that a local dwarf galaxy, Leo I, harbors a heavy-seed descendant. Using Monte-Carlo merger trees to generate the merger histories of 1,000 dark matter halos similar to the Milky Way (MW; with a mass of ${\sim} 10^{12}~{\rm M_\odot}$ at redshift $z{=}0$). We search for Leo-like satellite halos among these merger trees, and investigate the probability that the progenitors of some of these satellites formed a heavy seed. We derive the likelihood of such "heavy seed survivors" (HSSs) across various formation and survival criteria as well as Leo-similarity criteria. We find that the virial temperature for the onset of atomic cooling and rapid gas infall that yields heavy seeds, $T_{\rm act}$, has the largest impact on the number of HSSs. We find HSSs in a fraction $0.7\%$, $18.1\%$, and $96.5\%$ of MW-like halos when $T_{\rm act}$ is set to $9,000$K, $7,000$K, and $5,000$K respectively. This suggests that Leo I could be hosting a heavy seed and could provide an opportunity to disentangle heavy seeds from other SMBH formation mechanisms.
#### Kinematic and extinction analysis of a potential spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the structure of the Milky Way is essential for understanding its morphology, dynamics, and evolution. However, studying its innermost regions is challenging due to high extinction and crowding. The detection of a double red clump (RC; core-helium-burning stars) feature at very low Galactic latitudes suggests the presence of a spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar, providing new insights into the Galaxy's structure along this complex line of sight. We evaluate this possibility by analysing the proper motion and extinction distributions of the detected RC features. We constructed proper motion and extinction difference maps to investigate the kinematic and reddening properties of the RC populations, and the kinematic differences were validated using N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that the two RC features are kinematically distinct, with a relative proper motion difference of $-0.16\pm0.02\, mas/yr$ in the component parallel to the Galactic plane. This difference can be explained by Galactic rotation if the two RCs lie at different distances, consistent with the simulations. The extinction towards the secondary RC is also $\sim0.05$ mag higher than that of the primary RC. Additionally, we estimate that the extinction difference between the RC features corresponds to only $\sim5\%$ of the total extinction from Earth to the first RC, suggesting little interstellar material between the farthest edge of the Galactic bar and the kinematically distinct structure traced by the secondary RC. Using $JK_s$ photometry, we derive $A_J/A_{K_s}=3.34\pm0.07$, consistent with previous results and showing no significant variation across fields or along the line of sight. The results support the secondary clump tracing a distant structure, possibly a spiral arm, although we cannot exclude that the population belongs to the disc.
#### Synthetic JWST galaxy images in the TNG50 simulation - I. Model validation and comparison to observations
 - **Authors:** Alejandro Guzmán-Ortega, Gustavo Bruzual, Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez, Lars Hernquist
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04780

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04780

 - **Abstract**
 We use the TNG50 cosmological simulation and three-dimensional radiative transfer post-processing to generate dust-aware synthetic observations of galaxies at $ 3 \leq z \leq 6 $ and $ \log_{10}(M_\ast/\mathrm{M}_\odot) \geq 8.5 $, tailored to match the depth and resolution of current deep JWST surveys (NGDEEP and JADES). We analyse the performance of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting on the simulated sample, focusing on the recovery of photometric redshift and stellar mass. At $ z \leq 5 $, we find that 90 per cent of redshifts are recovered within $ \pm0.2 $, but performance declines at $ z = 6 $. Stellar masses are generally well-recovered within a factor of 2, but are systematically underestimated regardless of redshift, a trend that is more pronounced at the high-mass end $ ( \log_{10}(M_\ast/\mathrm{M}_\odot) \geq 10 ) $. In addition, we study the observer-frame colours of galaxies in this redshift range as well as the SED-inferred $UVJ$ diagram. We find that TNG50 galaxies broadly follow the tendencies marked by observations, but tend to be slightly redder at lower masses and bluer at higher masses, regardless of redshift. Finally, using a colour-based definition of quiescence, we determine the fraction of quiescent galaxies as a function of stellar mass at $ 3 \leq z \leq 6 $, which we find to be broadly consistent with observations.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04843

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of the distant Universe are providing key insights into our understanding of the formation of galaxies. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has significantly enhanced our observational capabilities, leading to an expanded redshift frontier, providing unprecedented detail in the characterization of early galaxies and enabling the discovery of new populations of accreting black holes. This review aims to provide an introduction to the basic processes and components that shape the observed spectra of galaxies, with a focus on their relevance to techniques with which high-redshift galaxies are selected. The review further introduces specific topics that have attracted significant attention in recent literature, including the discovery of highly efficient galaxy formation in the early Universe, the relation between galaxies and the process of reionization, new insights into the formation of the first stars and the enrichment of interstellar gas with heavy elements, and breakthroughs in our understanding of the origins of supermassive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters have been extensively used as tracers of Galactic chemical evolution, as their constituent stars possess shared characteristics, including age, Galactocentric radius, metallicity, and chemical composition. By examining the trends of elemental abundances with metallicity, age, and Galactocentric radius, valuable insights can be gained into the distribution and nucleosynthetic origins of chemical elements across the Galactic disc. The infrared domain in particular facilitates the observation of some elemental abundances that can be challenging or impossible to discern in the optical, for example K and F. The objective of this study is to derive the stellar parameters and elemental abundances of up to 23 elements in 114 stars spanning 41 open clusters using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. In addition, the present study aims to examine the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc. This is achieved by investigating radial abundance gradients, variations in abundance between clusters, and the dependence of chemical abundances on cluster age.

 - **Abstract**
 The papers included in this Focus Point collection are devoted to the studies on the cosmological tensions and challenges stimulated by the latest observational data. The first results of the LARES-2 laser ranging satellite on the high precision testing of the frame-dragging effect predicted by General Relativity are presented. The data on the S-stars monitoring in the Galactic center obtained by GRAVITY collaboration were analysed within the Physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach. The results enabled to probe the role of the cosmological constant, of the dark matter, the star cluster in the core of the Galaxy obtaining an upper limit for the star density. The topics include the conversion of high-frequency relic gravitational waves into photons in cosmological magnetic field, cosmological gravitational waves stochastic background generation through the spontaneous breaking of a global baryon number symmetry, observational predictions of the Starobinsky inflation model and other studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) halos form hierarchically in the Universe through a series of merger events. Cosmological simulations can represent this series of mergers as a graph-like ``tree'' structure. Previous work has shown these merger trees are sensitive to cosmology simulation parameters, but as DM structures, the outstanding question of their sensitivity to DM models remains unanswered. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of deep learning methods trained on merger trees to infer Warm Dark Matter (WDM) particles masses from the DREAMS simulation suite. We organize the merger trees from 1,024 zoom-in simulations into graphs with nodes representing the merger history of galaxies and edges denoting hereditary links. We vary the complexity of the node features included in the graphs ranging from a single node feature up through an array of several galactic properties (e.g., halo mass, star formation rate, etc.). We train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the WDM mass using the graph representation of the merger tree as input. We find that the GNN can predict the mass of the WDM particle ($R^2$ from 0.07 to 0.95), with success depending on the graph complexity and node features. We extend the same methods to supernovae and active galactic nuclei feedback parameters $A_\text{SN1}$, $A_\text{SN2}$, and $A_\text{AGN}$, successfully inferring the supernovae parameters. The GNN can even infer the WDM mass from merger tree histories without any node features, indicating that the structure of merger trees alone inherits information about the cosmological parameters of the simulations from which they form.
#### Investigating the imprints of tidal features on simulated galaxy outskirts in LSST-like mock observations

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal features provide signatures of recent galaxy mergers, offering insights into the role of mergers in galaxy evolution. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will allow for an unprecedented study of tidal features around millions of galaxies. We use mock images of galaxies at $z\sim0$ ($z\sim0.2$ for \textsc{NewHorizon}) from \textsc{NewHorizon}, \textsc{eagle}, \textsc{IllustrisTNG}, and \textsc{Magneticum Pathfinder} simulations to predict the properties of tidal features in LSST-like images. We find that tidal features are more prevalent around blue galaxies with intrinsic colours $(g-i)\leq0.5$, compared to redder ones, at fixed stellar mass. This trend correlates with elevated specific star formation rates ($\mathrm{sSFR}>10^{-10}\mathrm{\:yr}^{-1}$), suggesting that merger-induced star formation contributes to the bluer colours. Tidal feature hosts in the red sequence appear to exhibit colour profiles offset to bluer colours for galaxies with stellar masses $10^{10}<M_{\star\mathrm{,\:30\:pkpc}}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{11}$, similarly blue cloud tidal feature host galaxies appear to have their colour profiles offset to bluer colours for $10^{9.5}<M_{\star\mathrm{,\:30\:pkpc}}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{10.5}$. However, the differences in colour profiles in either the red sequence or the blue cloud are not statistically robust and larger samples are needed to test if these differences are real. The predictions across the simulations are quantitatively distinct; therefore, LSST observations will allow us to further constrain the differences between different subgrid physics models.
#### Non-Gaussian Galaxy Stochasticity and the Noise-Field Formulation

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the stochastic, or noise, contributions to the galaxy density field within the effective field theory (EFT) of large-scale structure. Starting from the general, all-order expression of the EFT partition function, we elucidate how the stochastic contributions can be described by local nonlinear couplings of a single Gaussian noise field. We introduce an alternative formulation of the partition function in terms of such a noise field, and derive the corresponding field-level likelihood for biased tracers. This noise-field formulation can capture the complete set of stochastic contributions to the galaxy density at the field level in a normalized, positive-definite probability density which is suitable for numerical sampling. We illustrate this by presenting the first results of EFT-based field-level inference with non-Gaussian and density-dependent stochasticity on dark matter halos using LEFTfield.
