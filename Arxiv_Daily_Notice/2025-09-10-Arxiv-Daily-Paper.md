 - **Abstract**
 By opening up new avenues to statistically constrain astrophysics and cosmology with large-scale structure observations, the line intensity mapping (LIM) technique calls for novel tools for efficient forward modeling and inference. Implicit likelihood inference (ILI) from semi-numerical simulations provides a powerful setup for investigating a large model parameter space in a data-driven manner, therefore gaining significant recent attention. Using simulations of high-redshift 158$\mu$m [CII] and 88$\mu$m [OIII] LIM signals created by the LIMFAST code, we develop an ILI framework in a case study of learning the physics of early galaxy formation from the auto-power spectra of these lines or their cross-correlation with galaxy surveys. We leverage neural density estimation with normalizing flows to learn the mapping between the simulated power spectra and parameters that characterize the physics governing the star formation efficiency and the $\dot{\Sigma}_{\star}$-$\Sigma_\mathrm{g}$ relation of high-redshift galaxies. Our results show that their partially degenerate effects can be unambiguously constrained when combining [CII] with [OIII] measurements to be made by new-generation mm/sub-mm LIM experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The satellite population of the Milky Way is shaped by a range of astrophysical processes including mergers, star formation, feedback, and cosmic reionisation. Determining which processes most strongly influence its properties is challenging and a key test of galaxy formation models. We train a neural network on the GALFORM semi-analytic model and apply a variance-based sensitivity analysis to characterise the influence of 11 astrophysical parameters on two key observables: the satellite luminosity function, and the mass-metallicity relation. We find that: (1) the abundance of bright satellites ($\mathrm{M}_V \lesssim -13$) is regulated primarily by supernova feedback; (2) the faint end of the luminosity function is shaped by the interplay between feedback and reionisation; and (3) the mass-metallicity relation is governed almost exclusively by feedback at all masses. We are unable to find a combination of parameters in the fiducial model that fits the observed data for both statistics simultaneously. To understand why, we employ SHapley Additive exPlanations to capture the directionality of each parameter variation. This enables us to pinpoint the origin of tensions in the model, showing that parameter adjustments that regulate the abundance of faint satellites drive stellar metallicities to be an order of magnitude too low and vice versa. This internal "tug-of-war" leads us to consider extensions to the baseline model, such as metal loading in winds, or allowing the feedback strength to evolve with redshift. Our study highlights the value of interrogating complex physical models through a sensitivity analysis framework by revealing high-order parameter interactions and non-linear responses that traditional one-at-a-time variations would miss.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense young star clusters (YSCs) are ideal environments for dynamical interactions between stars and stellar mass black holes (BHs). In such dense environments, stars can undergo close encounters with BHs and fall within their tidal radius, resulting in micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs), transient phenomena with potential multi-messenger signatures. We performed a suite of direct N-body simulations using the PETAR code, to which we implemented new prescriptions for modeling micro-TDEs. We constructed a set of realistic YSC models including primordial binaries, based on the observed Milky Way population. Our simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution, supernova kicks, and stellar winds using the BSE code, and account for the Galactic tidal field via the GALPY library. We identify three dynamical channels for micro-TDE production: single star-single BH encounters, binary-mediated interactions (including supernova-kick triggers), and interactions involving higher-order multiple systems such as hierarchical triples and quadruples, as well as chaotic few-body interactions. Multiple encounters are the most efficient production channel, which dominates the total rate: 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs from YSCs are expected to be detectable by upcoming surveys, particularly the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, with detection rates potentially up to hundreds per year. The gravitational wave (GW) signals expected from micro-TDEs peak in the deci-Hertz band, making them accessible to future instruments such as the Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna and the Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Micro-TDEs emerge as promising multi-messenger sources, potentially offering unique insights into star cluster dynamics, stellar collisions, and the population of dormant stellar-mass BHs, through both electromagnetic and GW observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We studied 12 disk streams found in a 250$^3$ pc$^3$ volume in the solar neighborhood, which we define as coeval and comoving stellar structures with aspect ratios greater than 3:1. Using \emph{Gaia} Data Release 3 data and the advanced clustering algorithms \texttt{SigMA} and \texttt{Uncover}, we identified and characterized these streams beyond the search volume, doubling, on average, their known populations. We estimate the number density of disk streams to be $\approx 820$ objects\,/\,kpc$^3$ (for $|Z| < 100$\,pc), or surface densities of $\approx 160$ objects\,/\,kpc$^2$. These estimates surpass N-body estimates by one to two orders of magnitude and challenge the prevailing understanding of their destruction mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that these 12 disk streams are dynamically cold with 3D velocity dispersions between 2 and 5\,km\,s$^{-1}$, exhibit narrow sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and are highly elongated with average aspect ratios of 7:1, extending up to several hundred parsecs. We find evidence suggesting that one of the disk streams, currently embedded in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, is experiencing disruption, likely due to the primordial gas mass of the association.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar haloes and intra-cluster light around galaxies are crucial test beds for dark matter (DM) physics and galaxy formation models. We consider the role that the numerical resolution plays in the modelling of these systems by studying the stripping of satellites in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We focus on host haloes of total halo mass $M_\mathrm{200c}=10^{12-15}M_{\odot}$ and satellites of stellar mass $>10^{7}$$M_{\odot}$, and compare stellar halo / satellite properties across 9 IllustrisTNG runs with baryonic particle mass resolution between $8.5\times10^4M_{\odot}$ and $7\times10^8$$M_{\odot}$, using a Lagrangian-region technique to identify counterpart satellites across different resolution simulations of the same volume. We publish the corresponding catalogues alongside this paper. We demonstrate that the stripping of DM from satellites that orbit in group- and cluster-mass hosts is largely independent of resolution at least until 90 per cent of their initial mass at infall has been stripped. We do not find evidence for spurious disruption of galaxies due to insufficient resolution for the satellite masses we consider. By contrast, the stripping of stellar mass is strongly resolution-dependent: each factor of 8 improvement in particle stellar mass typically adds 2~Gyr to the stripping time. Improved numerical resolution within the IllustrisTNG model generally results in more compact satellites with larger stellar masses, which in turn generate more centrally concentrated stellar haloes and intra-cluster mass profiles. However, the concomitant increase in stellar mass of both satellites and hosts may still be the cause for the overprediction of the stellar halo mass at large host radii relative to observations seen in some previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilize the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation and evolution of cosmic voids from $z = 5.04$ to present day, using cold dark matter and (sub-) halo tracers in high-density samples. This includes the evolution of their global properties, such as size, shape, inner density, and average density, as well as their radial density profiles. Our results provide several key conclusions for void analyses in modern surveys. We demonstrate that a relative size framework is required, mitigating methodological selection effects and revealing the true physical evolution of densities around halo-defined voids. This necessity arises from our findings that a void's properties are more fundamentally tied to its rank within its contemporary population than to its absolute size. Using this framework, we show that the evolution of halo voids stabilizes at redshifts below $z \simeq 1$, driven primarily by cosmic expansion rather than ongoing halo formation. We further find that the matter evolution around these stable voids is remarkably well-described by linear growth theory, with deviations appearing as non-linear growth on small scales and suppressed growth in the largest voids, potentially driven by the influence of dark energy. This late-time stability and the predictable evolution confirm voids as pristine laboratories for probing the nature of dark energy with upcoming surveys.
#### Unveiling the Impact of Cosmic Rays on the Disc Sizes and Outflows from Dwarf Scales to Galaxy Groups

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are a non-thermal energy component in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (CGM) that can act as an additional feedback channel beyond thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN. They influence galaxy evolution by altering gas properties, regulating star formation, and shaping galactic outflows. We investigate these effects using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations, which incorporate CR transport and feedback on top of the Auriga galaxy formation model. Our simulations span a wide range of halo masses, from dwarf galaxies to small groups ($M_{200\mathrm{c}}= 10^{10} - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), allowing us to assess the mass-dependent impact of CRs in a cosmological setting. We find that CRs have the strongest impact in lower-mass galaxies ($M_{200\mathrm{c}} < 10^{12}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), where they suppress star formation rates by up to 50\%, reduce gas and stellar half-light radii, and drive outflows that reach higher velocities at the virial radius compared to simulations without CRs. These CR-enhanced outflows also transport more metals and magnetic fields into the CGM, leading to higher CGM metallicities, stronger magnetisation, and lower CGM temperatures. In more massive galaxies, CRs do not significantly affect star formation or outflow properties, likely because thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN dominate in this regime. However, CRs still influence galaxy morphology across all halo masses by reducing the gas half-mass radius and stellar half-light radius. Finally, variations in CR transport properties, such as different diffusion coefficients or the exclusion of Alfvén cooling, significantly affect star formation, CGM properties, and outflows in lower-mass galaxies. This sensitivity makes these galaxies key environments for testing CR transport models and refining our understanding of their role in galaxy evolution.
#### Morphological characteristics of protohalos and their connection to halo formation histories

 - **Abstract**
 Protohalos, primordial regions in the initial cosmic density field that evolve into dark matter halos, are crucial for understanding cosmic structure formation. Motivated by the potential to reconstruct protohalo positions and shapes from observed galaxies using a novel approach grounded in optimal transport theory, we revisit the relationship between the structural properties of protohalos and the formation histories, concentrations, and final morphologies of their associated dark matter halos. To better understand halo assembly, we introduce a new estimator defined by an integral over redshifts and compare its performance to $z_{50}$, the commonly used redshift at which half of the final halo mass is formed. We quantify protohalo structure using the three invariants of the inertia, deformation, and energy shear tensors. Although past research has correlated the first two invariants of the deformation and energy tensors with halo formation, our findings reveal that the third invariant also significantly correlates with the final halo shape. We discuss the prospect of using optimal transport to connect our protohalo results to observations of high-redshift protoclusters to better align theoretical models with observational data.
#### Conditions for Bar Formation in Bulgeless Disk Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 While bars are commonly observed in disk galaxies, the precise conditions governing their formation remain incompletely understood. To investigate these conditions, we perform a suite of N-body simulations of bulgeless disk galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^9 \leq M_d \leq 10^{11} \;M_\odot$. Our galaxy models are constructed based on the observed properties of nearby barred galaxies from the S4G survey, and we systematically vary the halo scale radius to isolate its dynamical influence. Bars in our simulations form via repeated swing amplifications of disk perturbations, sustained by feedback loops. The amplification factor $\Gamma$ depends on both the Toomre stability parameter $Q_T$ and the dimensionless wavelength $X$. Based on our simulation results, we propose a two-parameter bar formation criterion, $Q_T + 0.4(X - 1.4)^2 \leq 1.8$, corresponding to $\Gamma = 10$, which better captures the onset of bar formation than traditional one-parameter conditions. Bars in low-mass galaxies tend to be shorter and weaker, and are more susceptible to disruption by outer spiral arms. In contrast, bars in high-mass galaxies are longer, stronger, and more resilient to spiral interference. Bars in low-mass galaxies undergo only slight vertical thickening over time, whereas those in high-mass galaxies thicken rapidly via buckling instability.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the 3D cross-correlation between the absorption of the $z\sim 2.3$ Lyman-alpha forest measured by the COSMOS Lyman-Alpha Mapping And Tomography Observations (CLAMATO) survey, and 1642 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from several different surveys, including 3D-HST, CLAMATO, zCOSMOS-Deep, MOSDEF, and VUDS. For each survey, we compare the measured cross-correlation with models incorporating the galaxy linear bias as well as observed redshift dispersion and systematic redshift offset. The derived redshift dispersion and offsets are generally consistent with those expected from, e.g., spectroscopic redshifts measured with UV absorption lines or NIR emission lines observed with specific instruments, but we find hints of `fingers-of-god' caused by overdensities in the field. We combine our foreground galaxy sample, and split them into 3 bins of robustly-estimated stellar mass in order to study the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. For sub-samples with median stellar masses of $\log_{10}(M_* / M_\odot) = [9.23,9.71,10.21]$, we find galaxy biases of $b_g\approx [2.9, 3.3,4.7]$, respectively. A comparison with mock measurements from the Bolshoi-Planck $N$-body simulation yields corresponding halo masses of $\log_{10}(M_* / M_\odot) \approx [10.3,11.6,12.1]$ for these stellar mass bins. At the low mass end, our results suggest enhanced star formation histories in mild tension with predictions from previous angular correlation and abundance matching-based observations, and the IllustrisTNG simulation.
#### Cosmological simulations of the same spiral galaxy: satellite properties, the role of baryonic physics and star formation history in shaping dark matter cores/cusps

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the role of baryonic physics in shaping the population, structure, and internal dynamics of galactic subhalos using the Mochima suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. A refined method is developed to identify bound subhalo material by isolating the local gravitational potential and applying multi-criteria phase-space selection. This approach enables a robust characterisation of subhalo properties across five baryonic runs with varying prescriptions for star formation, and supernova and protostellar feedback, as well as a dark matter-only baseline. At the population level, we find that host halo concentration, modulated by baryonic feedback, is a key predictor of subhalo survival. Subhalos with more massive stellar components exhibit deeper internal potentials and enhanced resilience to tidal disruption. At the structural level, we identify a broad diversity in inner dark matter profiles, consistent with observations of dwarf galaxies. We show that this diversity correlates with both star formation history and environmental interaction. In particular, galaxies that form most of their stars early tend to retain steep cusps, while those with extended or recent star formation exhibit oscillating inner slopes shaped by bursty feedback and tidal perturbations. These findings suggest that the so-called "diversity problem" may reflect the complex interplay between feedback history and gravitational environment, rather than a breakdown of cold dark matter predictions.
#### Tidal disruption events in active galactic nuclei: on orbital inclination and Schwarzschild apsidal precession

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) mark a regime where traditional vacuum models fail to capture the full dynamics, especially due to interaction between stellar debris and pre-existing accretion disks. We perform meshless hydrodynamic simulations incorporating both general relativistic (GR) effects and radiative cooling to study TDEs in AGNs with different orbital inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}$) of the disrupted star, ranging from projected prograde to retrograde orbits. We post-process the simulations to derive multi-wavelength light curves and identify several distinct features in the light curves, including a precursor flare from early debris-disk collision and a major flare driven by fallback. The dynamics of the stellar debris and accretion disk, and subsequently the light curve features, are strongly affected by $\theta_{\rm inc}$ and GR effects. Retrograde orbits ($\theta_{\rm inc}=135^\circ$) yield a more luminous, shorter major flare and a more prominent precursor than prograde ones ($\theta_{\rm inc}=22.5^\circ$). During fallback, prograde cases ($\theta_{\rm inc} = 22.5^\circ$, $45^\circ$) develop a central cavity with spirals in the inner region of the AGN disk, leading to transient UV/X-ray suppression accompanied by oscillations, while higher inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}=90^\circ$, $135^\circ$) form a gradually tilting inner disk, potentially causing UV/X-ray dips via geometric effects at certain viewing angles. Relativistic apsidal precession alters stream collisions, producing structural differences in the inner disk, outer disk, and debris compared to Newtonian cases, and drives quasi-periodic signals in prograde configurations. These results provide predictive diagnostics for identifying AGN TDEs and interpreting observed light-curve diversity.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has identified some of the Universe's earliest galaxies, repeatedly pushing the frontier to ever higher redshifts and stellar masses. The presence of such extreme galaxies at such early times, with large stellar populations and high star-formation rates, naturally results in a tension between observation and theory. This tension between numerical models and observations can be either due to our underlying cosmological models or due to a gap in our understanding of early Universe astrophysics. In a prelude to this letter, we showed how the Renaissance simulations, which focused on high redshift galaxy formation were able to reconstruct similar stellar masses to the earliest and highest mass galaxies that had been discovered by JWST at the time of its publication (McCaffrey et al.2023). Since then many more galaxies have been discovered by JWST, in particular the "Mirage-or-Miracle" (MoM) survey broke the record recently with the highest redshift galaxy MoM-z14, which has a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \sim 14.44$ followed closely by GS-z14 with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \sim 14.3$. We investigate in this letter whether these newly discovered galaxies are in conflict with the Renaissance simulations and thus whether they are causing tension with our established models of cosmology and/or high-redshift astrophysics. We discover that MoM-z14's high mass at early redshift can be explained by the Renaissance simulation suite, whereas the extremely high stellar mass of GS-z14 remains an outlier when compared to previous measurements of high-redshift galaxies detected by JWST and our numerical models (even after accounting for cosmic variance).

 - **Abstract**
 Intrinsic alignments of galaxies are measured and modelled to gain cosmological information, to further understand the interactions between galaxies and to mitigate their effects on gravitational weak lensing studies. Hydrodynamical simulations are often used to constrain priors or calibrate models. Therefore, obtaining the maximum amount of information possible from these simulations is imperative. In this work, we have combined the information of shapes projected over two or three axes ($x,y,z$), for intrinsic alignment signals ($w_{g+},\ \tilde{\xi}_{g+,2}$), showing a consistent gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all cases studied using TNG300-1. The gain in SNR is found to be higher for the addition of the second projection than for the third, and higher for shapes calculated using the reduced inertia tensor rather than the simple one. The two shape samples studied, $n_\star>300$ and $\mathrm{log}(M_\star \ h/\mathrm{M_\odot})>10.5$, where the latter has a much higher signal amplitude, show similar gains in SNR when more projections are added. We also model the correlation functions with the non-linear alignment model. The SNR gains from the measurements are higher but consistent with the constraints on the non-linear alignment amplitude $A_{\rm IA}$ and galaxy bias $b_{\rm g}$. Using multiple projection axes increases SNR overall, enabling more efficient use of numerically expensive hydrodynamical simulations.
#### Unveiling Galactic substructures with M Giant stars: A kinematic and chemical study based on LAMOST DR9, Gaia DR3 and APOGEE DR17

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the updated M giant star catalog selected from LAMOST DR9, we iden-tify substructures within the integrals-of-motion space through Friends-of-Friends cluster-ing algorithm. We obtain members belonging to several known substructures: the Sagittarius stream, Galactic Anticenter Substructure (GASS), Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), Splash, and the high-{\alpha} disk. Furthermore, we also identify two groups which cannot be clearly asso-ciated with previously known substructures. Our findings confirm the existence of metal-rich constituents within the GES, representing newly formed stars that originated from the metal-enriched gas delivered during the GES merger event and subsequently evolved. Additionally, this study further expands the sample of GASS, high-{\alpha} disk, and Splash stars. Analysis of these metal-rich M giant stars as members of the GES, Splash, and high-{\alpha} disk compo-nents supports an evolution scenario for the early Milky Way, as proposed by previous stud-ies. In this scenario, stars initially formed in a high-{\alpha} primordial disk were dynamically heated by the massive accretion event (GES). This process redistributed stellar orbits, creat-ing the Splash population, while the undisturbed portion of the primordial disk persisted as the present-day high-{\alpha} disk component.

 - **Abstract**
 In the first paper of this series, we derived mass constraints on the total mass and the baryonic components of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063. The main focus was to recover stellar masses and kinematics for cluster members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). In this second paper, we introduce a multi-probe mass modelling approach that incorporates constraints on both the total mass and the individual baryonic components. We obtain comprehensive mass models of Abell S1063, in which the dark matter distribution is disentangled from the baryonic mass at both cluster and galaxy scales. The best-fitting mass model achieves an RMS of $0.50"$ on the multiple image positions. The kinematic profiles of the BCG \& ICL, as well as the X-ray surface brightness of the intra-cluster gas, are accurately reproduced within observational uncertainties. However, a $35~\mathrm{km/s}$ scatter is required for the cluster member line-of-sight dispersions. This method yields the most complex parametric mass model with consistency among almost all available mass constraints. We find a $1\sigma$ agreement between the inferred stellar-to-subhalo mass relation and that predicted by large-scale cosmological simulations. The ICL stellar mass derived from our model is consistent with estimates from stellar population modelling. We present the first multi-probe mass modelling method capable of disentangling the dark matter from the baryonic mass distributions in massive galaxy clusters. Its results, such as the stellar-to-subhalo mass relation or the distribution of each mass component, can be directly compared to hydrodynamical cosmological simulations such as illustrisTNG.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 5253 is a nearby (D=3.6 Mpc) Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy, notable for its three massive young super star clusters (SSCs) and nitrogen enrichment. Its similarity to extreme star-forming galaxies at high redshift makes it a good local analogue for studying chemical enrichment at high spatial resolution. We characterise the ionised gas and dust in the giant HII region in the proximity of the three SSCs in the centre of NGC 5253 using new Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer Narrow Field Mode adaptive optics-assisted data at unprecedented spatial resolution of 0."15$\sim$2.3 pc. We derive the attenuation for the central SSCs and, for the first time, map the extinction parameter ($R_V$) in an extragalactic object. $R_V$ varies among SSCs, suggesting differences in dust physics. Electron temperature and density diagnostics yield flat temperature distributions $T_\mathrm{e,median}$([NII])$=12000 \pm 1700$ K and $T_\mathrm{e,median}$([SIII])$ = 11000 \pm 600$ K, and a structured $n_e$([SII]) of maximum $1930 \pm 40$ cm$^{-3}$. The direct method gives a flat helium abundance ($10^3y^+ = 81 \pm 4$) and uniform oxygen abundance ($12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = 8.22 \pm 0.05$). N/O shows a factor 2-3 enhancement around the SSCs, mapped here for the first time at such high spatial resolution. The total excess nitrogen mass is $\sim$0.3 $M_\odot$, which we estimate is producible by the observed WN-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Because there is no direct spatial overlap between the enrichment and WR star positions, the N-rich material appears to have been expelled from the original sites.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR > 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) and the faint group (SFR < 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T > 0.5, n > 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T < 0.35, n < 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge <= 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.
