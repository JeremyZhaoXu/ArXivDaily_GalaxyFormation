 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way is surrounded by large amounts of hot gas at temperatures T>10^6 K, which represents a major baryon reservoir. We here explore the prospects of studying the hot coronal gas in Milky Way halo by analyzing the highly forbidden optical coronal lines of [FeX] and [FeXIV] in absorption against bright extragalactic background sources. We use a semi-analytic model of the Milky Way's coronal gas distribution together wih HESTIA simulations of the Local Group and observational constraints to predict the expected FeX and FeXIV column densities as well as the line shapes and strengths. We predict column densities of log N(FeX)=15.40 and log N(FeXIV)=15.23 in the Milky Way's hot halo and estimate that a minimum S/N of 50,000 (25,000) is required to detect [FeX] l6374.5 ([FeXIV] l5302.9) absorption at a 3sigma level. Using archical optical data from an original sample of 739 high resolution AGN spectra from VLT/UVES and KECK/HIRES, we generate a stacked composite spectrum to measure an upper limit for the column densities of FeX and FeXIV in the Milky Way's coronal gas. No [FeX] and [FeXIV] is detected in our composite spectrum, which achieves a maximum S/N= 1,240 near 5300 A. We derive 3sigma upper column-density limits of log N(FeX)<16.27 and log N(FeXIV)<15.85, in line with the above-mentioned predictions. While [FeX] and [FexIX] absorption is too weak to be detected with current optical data, we outline how up-coming extragalactic spectral surveys with millions of medium- to high-resolution optical spectra will provide the necessary sensitivity and spectral resolution to measure velocity-resolved [FeX] and [FeXIV] absorption in the Milky Way's coronal gas (and beyond). This gives the prospect of opening a new window for studying the dominant baryonic mass component of the Milky Way in the form of hot coronal gas via optical spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are singular outbursts of high-energy radiation with durations typically lasting from milliseconds to minutes and, in extreme cases, a few hours. They are attributed to the catastrophic outcomes of stellar-scale events and, as such, are not expected to recur. Here, we present observations of an exceptional GRB\,250702BDE which triggered the {\em Fermi} gamma-ray burst monitor on three occasions over several hours, and which was detected in soft X-rays by the \textit{Einstein Probe} a day before the $\gamma$-ray triggers (EP250702a). We present the discovery of an extremely red infrared counterpart of the event with the VLT, as well as radio observations from MeerKAT. Hubble Space Telescope observations pinpoint the source to a non-nuclear location in a host galaxy with complex morphology, implying GRB 250702BDE is an extragalactic event. The multi-wavelength counterpart is well described with standard afterglow models at a relatively low redshift $z \sim 0.2$, but the prompt emission does not readily fit within the expectations for either collapsar or merger-driven GRBs. Indeed, a striking feature of the multiple prompt outbursts is that the third occurs at an integer multiple of the interval between the first two. Although not conclusive, this could be indicative of periodicity in the progenitor system. We discuss several possible scenarios to explain the exceptional properties of the burst, which suggest that either a very unusual collapsar or the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate-mass black hole are plausible explanations for this unprecedented GRB.
#### AMICO galaxy clusters in KiDS-1000: cosmological sample

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Galaxy clusters provide key insights into cosmic structure formation, galaxy formation and are essential for cosmological studies. Aims. We present a catalog of galaxy clusters detected in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-DR4) optimized for cosmological analyses and investigations of cluster properties. Each detection includes probabilistic membership assignments for the KiDS-DR4 galaxies within the magnitude range 15<r'<24. Methods. Using the Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) algorithm, we identified 23965 clusters over an effective area of about 839 deg2 in the redshift range $0.1\le z \le0.9$, with a signal-to-noise ratio $S/N>3.5$. The sample is highly homogeneous across the entire survey thanks to the restrictive galaxy selection criteria we adopted. Spectroscopic data from the GAMA survey were used to calibrate the clusters photometric redshift and assess their uncertainties. We introduced algorithmic enhancements to AMICO to mitigate border effects among neighbor tiles. Quality flags are also provided for each cluster detection. The sample purity and completeness assessments have been estimated using the SinFoniA data driven approach, thus avoiding strong assumptions embedded in numerical simulations. We introduced a blinding scheme of the selection function meant to support the cosmological analyses. Results. Our cluster sample includes 321 cross-matches with the X-ray eRASS1 "primary" sample and 235 matches with the ACT-DR5 cluster sample. We derived a mass-proxy scaling relation based on intrinsic richness, $\lambda_*$, using masses from the eRASS1 catalog. Conclusions. The KiDS-DR4 cluster catalog provides a valuable data set for investigating galaxy cluster properties and contributes to cosmological studies by offering a large, well-characterized cluster sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) as excellent beacons to black hole (BH) accreting systems have been studied for more than five decades with a single star tidally disrupted by a central massive BH. However, if considering two stars passing through a central BH and being tidally disrupted in a short period, so-called double TDEs could be expected and lead to unique variability features very different from features from standard TDEs. Here, we report such oversimplified double TDEs in the known changing-look AGN Mrk1018, of which 15years-long light curve with plateau features can be described by two main-sequence stars tidally disrupted by the central supermassive BH. Meanwhile, the BH mass determined by the double TDEs is consistent with the M-sigma relation determined value by the measured stellar velocity dispersions in Mrk1018. The results indicate tight connections between the TDEs and the changing-look properties in Mrk1018.

 - **Abstract**
 Much of the carbonaceous dust observed in the early universe may originate from colliding wind binaries (CWBs) hosting hot, luminous Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Downstream of the shock between the stellar winds there exists a suitable environment for dust grain formation, and the orbital motion of the stars wraps this dust into richly structured spiral geometries. The Apep system is the most extreme WR-CWB in our Milky Way: two WR stars produce a complex spiral dust nebula, whose slow expansion has been linked to a gamma-ray burst progenitor. It has been unclear whether the O-type supergiant 0.7" distant from the WR+WR binary is physically associated with the system, and whether it affects the dusty nebula. Multi-epoch VLT/VISIR and JWST/MIRI observations show that this northern companion star routinely carves a cavity in the dust nebula - the first time such an effect has been observed in a CWB - which unambiguously associates the O star as a bound component to the Apep system. These observations are used together with a new geometric model to infer the cavity geometry and the orbit of the WR+WR binary, yielding the first strong constraints on wind and orbital parameters. We confirm an orbital period of over 190 years for the inner binary - nearly an order of magnitude longer than the next longest period dust-producing WR-CWB. This, together with the confirmed classification as a hierarchical triple, cements Apep as a singular astrophysical laboratory for studying colliding winds and the terminal life stages of the most massive star systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources (ULXs and HLXs) are among the brightest astrophysical objects in the X-ray sky. While ULXs most likely host stellar-mass compact objects accreting at super-Eddington rates, HLXs are compelling candidates for accreting intermediate-mass black holes. Our goal is to produce a clean sample of HLXs by removing possible contaminants and characterise the spectral properties of the remaining population. Starting with a set of 115 HLXs detected by XMM-Newton, we identified and removed contaminants (AGNs, X-ray diffuse emission detected as point-like, and tidal disruption event candidates) and retrieved 40 sources for which XMM-Newton spectra are available. We fitted them with an absorbed power law model and determined their unabsorbed luminosities and hardness ratios. We constructed the hardness-luminosity diagram, compared the results with the spectral properties of the HLX prototype, ESO 243-49 HLX-1, and conducted a deeper analysis on a few promising candidates. The resulting HLX population spans a luminosity range from $1\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to nearly $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and is homogeneously spread in hardness between 0.5 and 5. Half of the population has hardness ratios higher than a typical AGN, and could be considered the extension of the ULX population at higher energies. We found four very soft outliers, which are characterised by steep power law spectra and no X-ray emission above 1$-$2 keV, similarly to ESO 243-49 HLX-1. Those with multi-epoch archival data show changes in luminosity up to almost two orders of magnitudes. We show that sources currently identified as HLXs can be more diverse than ULXs and disentangling between different types of objects is not trivial with currently available data. New observations would be beneficial to expand the current sample and uncover the true nature of many objects of this class.

 - **Abstract**
 Thin and thick discs are prominent components in the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies, but their formation histories are not yet understood, which is particularly true for thick discs. This is partially due to the fact that we lack sufficient understanding of thin and thick discs in other galaxies to determine how common features of the Milky Way's discs are. Here, we conduct an integral field spectroscopy study of the thin and thick discs in the edge-on Milky Way analogue IC 2531, using observational data from the WiFeS IFU spectrograph on the ANU 2.3m telescope. We provide spectral analysis of IC 2531's kinematics and stellar populations in the thin and thick disc regions by conducting pPXF fitting with Vazdekis models. We found that IC 2531's disc above the dust plane generally has chemical properties between the Milky Way's chemical thin and thick disc. IC 2531's thick disc is somewhat similar to the Milky Way's in terms of stellar populations: on average, it is older, more metal-poor than its corresponding thin disc, but similarly alpha-enhanced in general. But we do find a clearly alpha-rich thick disc bin though one of our "thick disc" bins may be dominated by a warped thin disc. These results may help to constrain formation theories of thick discs.

 - **Abstract**
 The WALOPControl software is designed to facilitate comprehensive control and operation of the WALOP (Wide Area Linear Optical Polarimeter) polarimeters, ensuring safe and concurrent management of various instrument components and functionalities. This software encompasses several critical requirements, including control of the filter wheel, calibration half-wave plate, calibration polarizer, guider positioning, focusers, and 4 concurrent CCD cameras. It also manages the host telescope and dome operations while logging operational parameters, user commands, and environmental conditions for troubleshooting and stability. It provides a user-friendly graphical user interface, secure access control, a notification system for errors, and a modular configuration for troubleshooting are integral to the software's architecture. It is accessible over the internet with the backend developed using NodeJS and ExpressJS, featuring a RESTful API that interacts with a MongoDB database, facilitating real-time status updates and data logging. The frontend utilizes the this http URL framework, with Redux for state management and Material UI for the graphical components. The system also allows for automatic observations based on user-defined schedules. A Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI CD) pipeline ensures the software's reliability through automated testing and streamlined deployment. The WALOPControl software is a key component of the PASIPHAE (Polar-Areas Stellar Imaging in Polarimetry High Accuracy Experiment) project, which aims to study the dust and magnetic field of the Milky Way by observing the polarization of starlight.

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters serve as important tools for accurately studying the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. By combining precise chemical data from high-resolution spectra with information on their distances and ages, we can effectively uncover the processes that have shaped our Galaxy. This study aims to derive NLTE atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for approximately one hundred giant stars across 33 open clusters with near-solar metallicity. The clusters span a wide range of ages, enabling an assessment of the presence and extent of any age-related abundance gradients. In the Stellar Population Astrophysics (SPA) project, we acquired new high-resolution spectra of open clusters using the HARPS-N echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. We chemically characterized nine open clusters for the first time and reanalyzed previously studied SPA clusters, resulting in a consistent and homogeneous sample. We determined NLTE atmospheric parameters using the equivalent width method and derived NLTE chemical abundances through spectral synthesis for various elements, including alpha elements (Mg, Si, and Ti), light odd-Z elements (Na, Al), iron-peak elements (Mn, Co, and Ni), and neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Eu). Our findings are compared with the existing literature, revealing good agreement. We examine the trends of [X/Fe] versus age, confirming previous observations and the enrichment patterns predicted by nucleosynthesis processes. Positive correlations with age are present for Mg, Si, Ti, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, and Sr, while Na and Y and Eu show a negative trend. This study emphasizes the significance of NLTE corrections and reinforces the utility of open clusters as tracers of Galactic chemical evolution. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark sample of NLTE abundances for upcoming open cluster surveys within large-scale projects such as 4MOST and WEAVE.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The origin and nature of spiral arms remain unclear. Star forming regions and young stars are generally strongly associated to the spiral structure, but there are few quantitative predictions from simulations about the involvement of stars of different ages. Aims. We aim to quantify the interplay between spiral arms and different populations. Methods. We use a hydrodynamical simulation of an isolated disc galaxy displaying a dynamic multi-armed spiral structure. Inspired by cosmological structure metrics, we develop a new method, the local dimension, that robustly delineates arms across populations and through space and time. Results. We find that all stars, including those as old as 11Gyr, support the arms. The spiral strength decreases with stellar age up to 2Gyr-old stars and remains nearly constant for older stars. However, the scaling between arm strength and age (or velocity dispersion) depends on the strength of the global spiral structure at each time. Almost all stars formed in arms remain within them for no more than 140-180Myr, whereas old stars leave arms about three times faster. Even if the youngest populations dominate in the production of the spiral torques at early times, all populations contribute equally at later times. Conclusions. Our results highlight the power of the local dimension for studying complex spiral structures and show that all stellar populations in the disc partake in the arms. Since in our model we see spiral arms in populations with velocity dispersions up to 90km/s, which are comparable to those of the Milky Way, we predict that old Galactic populations could also exhibit spiral structure.
#### Delayed Launch of Ultrafast Outflows in the Tidal Disruption Event AT2020afhd

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection and characterization of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) in the X-ray spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020afhd, based on observations from NICER, Swift, and XMM. Prominent blueshifted absorption features were detected exclusively during the intermediate phase of the event, occurring between days 172 and 212 within the first 300 days post-discovery. During this period, the UFO appeared no earlier than day 74, strengthened between days 172 and 194, and disappeared after day 215. This marks the first time that the full evolutionary sequence of X-ray outflows has been observed in a TDE. Moreover, the outflows exhibited a dramatic deceleration from ~0.19c to ~0.0097c over a span of approximately 10 days. Photoionization spectral analysis reveals an inverse correlation between outflow velocity and ionization parameter, in contradiction to the predictions from radiation pressure-driven wind. Eventually, we propose that the delayed onset of the outflows may result from an increase in the wind opening angle and/or metal enrichment, particularly iron and oxygen, during the disk formation phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently discovered supermassive black holes with masses of $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim9$-$11$ in active galactic nuclei (AGN) pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars (SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $<10^6\,M_\odot$. They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness $\sim10^{45\mathrm{-}47}\,\mathrm{erg/s}$ and last $10$-$200$ years in the source frame - up to $250$-$3000$ years with cosmic time dilation. This makes them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots and AGN within $0.5$-$9\,(1+z)$ yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in long-wavelength JWST filters up to $z\leq20$ ($24$-$26$ mag) and pulsating SMSs up to $z\leq15$. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS explosions at $z<11$-$12$. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down to $10^{-11}$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep fields.
