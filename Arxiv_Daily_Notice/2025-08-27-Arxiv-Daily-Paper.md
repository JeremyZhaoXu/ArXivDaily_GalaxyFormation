 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge of the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies provides crucial insight into disk assembly, quenching, and chemical evolution. However, most reconstructions, both for the Milky Way and for external galaxies, implicitly assume that stars formed at their present-day radii. Using a range of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we show that stellar radial migration introduces strong and systematic biases in such SFH estimates. In the inner disk (R < h_d), early star formation is typically underestimated by 25-50% and late star formation overestimated, giving the misleading impression of prolonged, moderate activity. An exception occurs in the very central bin considered (~ 0.4h_d), which is consistently overestimated due to a net inflow of inward migrators. At intermediate radii and in the outer disk, migration drives the opposite trend: intermediate-age populations are overestimated by 100-200% as stars born in the inner disk migrate outward, whereas genuinely in-situ populations are underestimated by ~ 50% as they themselves continue to migrate. The net effect is that SFH peaks are suppressed and broadened, and the true rate of inside-out disk growth is systematically underestimated. These distortions affect all galaxies in our sample and have direct implications for interpreting spatially resolved SFHs from IFU surveys such as CALIFA and MaNGA, where present-day radii are often used as proxies for stellar birth sites. Correcting these biases will require accounting for disk mass, bar presence, disk kinematics and morphology, while recent birth-radius estimation techniques for Milky Way stars offer a promising path forward.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust plays a pivotal role in shaping the observed morphology of galaxies. While traditional cosmological simulations often assume a fixed dust-to-gas (DTG) or dust-to-metal (DTM) mass ratio to model dust effects, recent advancements have enabled on-the-fly (OTF) dust modeling that captures the spatial and temporal evolution of dust. In this work, we investigate the impact of dust modeling on galaxy morphology using the NewCluster simulation, which implements a detailed OTF dust model. We generate mock images of NewCluster galaxies under both OTF and fixed DTM models using the radiative transfer code SKIRT, and compare their morphology to JWST observations. We measure morphology indices and use the $G-M_{20}$ test to classify galaxies. We find that the OTF galaxy models exhibit brighter centers and more pronounced bulges than those of the fixed DTM models, resulting in a lower late-type galaxy (LTG) fraction, particularly at high redshifts. This central brightening is linked to a phenomenon we refer to as the DTM cavity, a localized depression in the DTM ratio driven by intense bulge starbursts. Our results highlight the importance of modeling dust evolution in a physically motivated manner, as fixed DTM models fail to capture key morphological features.

 - **Abstract**
 If dark matter (DM) exists in halos around rotating neutron stars (NSs), it will be essential to understand the effects of rotation on the distribution of DM and baryonic matter (BM) in the stars to interpret observations. In this work, we construct rapidly rotating dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) with DM halos using the two-fluid approximation, where the BM and DM interact only through gravity. Our goal is to describe rapidly rotating millisecond-period DANS spun up by the accretion of BM from a zero angular momentum state. We extend the Rapidly Rotating Neutron Star (RNS) code to compute axisymmetric configurations in which the BM rotates rigidly while the DM remains torque-free and differentially rotates through the frame-dragging of spacetime. For the first time, we examine in detail local and global definitions of mass in general relativity for two-fluid systems, showing how their differences affect the interpretation of baryonic and dark component masses. We compute energy density and frame-dragging frequency profiles for DANS with three different characteristic DM halos. We demonstrate that rapid BM rotation reduces DM halo sizes if central energy densities are kept constant between non-rotating and rotating models. We also construct sequences of DANS to create mass and radius curves and compare rotating and non-rotating cases. Finally, we quantify deviations in the spacetime metric outside the baryonic surfaces of these sequences of stars caused by the DM halos. We hypothesize that the size of this quantity could indicate whether a DM halo will significantly impact X-ray pulse profile modeling. These results provide a framework for assessing the observational consequences of DM halos around rapidly rotating NSs.
#### Super-Accreting Active Galactic Nuclei as Neutrino Sources

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) often exhibit broad-line regions (BLRs), populated by high-velocity clouds in Keplerian orbits around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) at subparsec scales. During episodes of intense super-Eddington accretion, the disk can launch a powerful radiation-driven wind that overtakes the BLR clouds, forming bowshocks. Two shocks arise: one into the wind and another into the cloud. If adiabatic, electrons and protons are efficiently accelerated via Fermi processes to relativistic energies. In dense winds, the resulting high-energy photons are absorbed and reprocessed within the photosphere, while neutrinos from inelastic $pp$ collisions escape. We explore the potential of super-accreting AGNs as neutrino sources and propose a new class of emitter: an AGN without jets or gamma-ray counterparts, but with a strong opaque disk wind. As a case study, we consider a SMBH with $M_{\rm BH}=10^6,M_{\odot}$ and accretion rates consistent with tidal disruption events (TDEs). We compute the main cooling processes for relativistic particles and show that super-Eddington SMBHs can produce detectable neutrino fluxes with only weak electromagnetic signatures. Such fluxes may be observable by IceCube-Gen2 in nearby galaxies with a high BLR cloud filling factor. For more massive black holes, detection remains possible with moderate filling factors if the source is close, or at larger distances if the filling factor is high. Our model thus provides a plausible scenario for extragalactic neutrino sources, where both flux and timescale are determined by the number of orbiting clouds and the duration of the super-accreting phase.

 - **Abstract**
 The dSphs around the Milky Way are commonly considered as systems that are supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravitation. They have been long accounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the GeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or background emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO for the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an original selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we calculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete available samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars, adopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In this way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for general indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out of a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets - DraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII in the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either cored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for other DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO will provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of velocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the best targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the still imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint dSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized on a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of targets.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm Intensity Mapping (IM) holds the potential to map the large-scale structures in the Universe over a wide redshift range $(z \lesssim 5.5)$, measure cosmological parameters, and shed light on the nature of dark energy. In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is distributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the HIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we investigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and bispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation, which quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we consider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured 21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \le k_{ul} = 0.32 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are well modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely $[\Omega_{\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS and BS with an independent measurement of $\Omega_{\rm HI} $, we show that it is possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation. We expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy formation and the evolution of the ISM. Our preliminary analysis ignores redshift space distortion and the system noise in IM observations, which we plan to address in future work.
