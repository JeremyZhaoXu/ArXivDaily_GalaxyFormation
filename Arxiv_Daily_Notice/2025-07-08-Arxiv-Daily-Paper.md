 - **Abstract**
 Modern cosmological inference increasingly relies on differentiable models to enable efficient, gradient-based parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Here, we present a novel approach for predicting the abundance of dark matter haloes and their cosmology dependence using a differentiable, field-level neural network (NN) model, and study how well the cosmology dependence is captured by common parametrisations of the halo mass function (HMF), and by our NN-based approach. By training a 3D U-Net on initial density fields from fast N-body simulations with varying cosmological parameters, we enable direct, differentiable mapping from the linear density field to protohalo patches and their mass bins. Our method achieves competitive accuracy in identifying protohalo regions and in capturing the dependence of the HMF on cosmological parameters. Our NN derivatives agree well with finite differences of both analytical and emulated HMFs, at the level of the disagreement among the different models. We further demonstrate how the NN model can additionally be used to investigate the response of the HMF to changes in the initial Gaussian random field. Finally, we also demonstrate that a differentiable model can be used to extrapolate existing models at very high precision.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulation-based inference (SBI) has become an important tool in cosmology for extracting additional information from observational data using simulations. However, all cosmological simulations are approximations of the actual universe, and SBI methods can be sensitive to model misspecification - particularly when the observational data lie outside the support of the training distribution. We present a method to improve the robustness of cosmological analyses under such conditions. Our approach first identifies and discards components of the summary statistics that exhibit inconsistency across related simulators, then learns a transformation that brings the observation back within the support of the training distribution. We apply our method in the context of a recent SimBIG SBI galaxy clustering analysis using the wavelet scattering transform (WST) summary statistic. The original analysis struggled to produce robust constraints for certain subsets of WST coefficients, where the observational data appeared out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the training data. We show that our method enables robust cosmological inference and resolves OOD issues, while preserving most of the constraining power. In particular, the improved SimBIG WST analysis yields $\Lambda$CDM constraints of $\Omega_m = 0.32^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.80^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, which are respectively $1.4\times$ and $3.1\times$ tighter than those from a standard perturbation-theory-based power spectrum analysis, confirming the significant information gain of WST summary statistics. The proposed method is easily applicable to other cosmological SBI contexts and represents a step toward more robust SBI pipelines.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the science case for characterizing the nature of the first stars using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy with the HWO has the potential to confirm any surviving low-mass zero-metallicity first stars by placing unprecedented low limits on their metal abundances. It also has the potential to substantially increase the number of elements detectable in the spectra of known long-lived low-mass stars, which exhibit extremely low metal abundances that reveal the metals produced by the first stars. Elements important for this science case with UV transitions include C, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. HWO would expand the discovery space when compared with the Hubble Space Telescope by enabling high-resolution UV spectroscopy for much fainter stars throughout the Milky Way and neighboring stellar systems.
#### What Sets the Metallicity of Ultra-Faint Dwarfs?

 - **Abstract**
 We use intergalactic medium (IGM) metallicity distributions from several state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of Milky Way analogs and a semi-analytic model of ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) formation to model the stellar metallicities of UFDs in MW-like environments. We study simulations with different treatments of star formation, stellar feedback, and Population III enrichment, and in all cases, we find that only a few percent of the IGM accretable by UFD progenitors is enriched to metallicities $\rm [Fe/H]\ge-4$. When the metallicity of accreted IGM in the semi-analytic galaxy formation model is set using these IGM metallicity distributions, the model underpredicts UFD metallicities and their scatter compared to the observed luminosity--metallicity relation. Our results indicate that IGM enrichment is not the dominant mechanism setting metallicities of UFD stars. Instead, UFD stellar metallicity is determined primarily by the interplay between internal enrichment and metal loss through feedback-driven outflows. We examine models with different values of the maximum outflow mass loading factor $\eta_{\rm max}$ and show that the full range of average stellar metallicities of UFDs at $M_V<-7$ can be reproduced if the maximum mass loading factor varies in the range $200\lesssim\eta_{\rm max}\lesssim 2000$. We also consider stellar metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) within individual model galaxies with different assumptions about IGM enrichment and $\eta_{\rm max}$. We find that all considered models are in reasonable agreement with observed UFD MDFs, with model differences less than the uncertainties of current metallicity measurements.
#### Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the possibility that the recently identified population of high-redshift, obscured quasars - known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) - originates from early black hole seed formation driven by ultra-strongly self-interacting dark matter (uSIDM). In this framework, dark matter halos undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds with masses $\gtrsim 10^{5} M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$. We develop a semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo population, the redshift of collapse $z_{\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve in standard CDM-based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \sim 5$ shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7} M_\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational tracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early universe could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter interactions.
#### SKYSURF IX -- The Cosmic Optical and Infrared Background from Integrated Galaxy Light Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the SKYSURF Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Legacy Archival program we present galaxy number counts which yield measurements of the extragalactic background light (EBL) at 15 different wavelengths. We have processed 82,752 HST images across 23 filters into 16,686 mosaics using the same software and processing pipeline throughout. Using 17/23 filters that give reliable galaxy counts, we constrain the integrated galaxy light (IGL) with a 1.5-9\% error between 0.3 and 1.6 $\mu$m in combination with 8 bands from WAVES (Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey) and DEVILS (Deep Extragalactic Visible Legacy Survey). While HST was never intended to undertake large area surveys, through extensive quality control and filtering, we were able to extract a reliable and representative sample of fields distributed across the sky. Our final catalogs cover a combined $\approx 19.6 °^2$, with individual filters covering areas ranging from $\approx 0.16-7.0 °^2$. The combination of numerous independent sight-lines and area coverage allows us to reduce cosmic variance uncertainties in deep number counts to 0.06\%-1.8\%. For the first time we are able to establish a measurement of the IGL, $\mathrm{9.07 \pm 0.35 nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$, at 0.59 $\mu$m using HST data. We obtain a cosmic optical background value of $ 24.45 \pm 0.50 \mathrm{nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$. Different techniques used to measure the COB, both directly and indirectly, have recently converged indicating that the COB arises almost exclusively from processes within galaxies. This in combination with the recent values reported from New Horizons and very high energy (VHE) constraints leaves very little room for any diffuse emission coming from outside the Milky Way.
#### FEAST: probing the stellar population of the starburst dwarf galaxy NGC4449 with JWST/NIRCam

 - **Abstract**
 We present new JWST/NIRCam observations of the starburst irregular galaxy NGC 4449, obtained in Cycle 1 as part of the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program, which we use to investigate its resolved stellar populations and their spatial distributions. NGC4449 NIR color-magnitude diagrams reveal a broad range of stellar populations, spanning different evolutionary phases, from young main sequence stars, to old red giant branch stars and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The analysis of their spatial distributions shows that younger (< 10 Myr) populations form an S-shaped distribution aligned with the galaxy's north-south axis, while stars aged 10 - 60 Myr show shifting concentrations from the north to the south, consistent with the possibility that external interactions or tidal effects may have triggered star formation in spatially distinct bursts. Clusters of comparable ages generally follow these distributions, suggesting that cluster and field stars form at the same pace in each galaxy region. Thanks to the unprecedented high-spatial resolution and sensitivity of the JWST data we recover a clear gap between Oxygen-rich and the carbon star branch of the AGB population and the presence of a massive AGB star "finger". The analysis of these stars can provide constraints on AGB evolution models and dust production in this galaxy. These results confirms NGC 4449 status as a compelling example of a local dwarf starburst galaxy undergoing complex and possibly external driven star formation and underscore the power of JWST in probing the full lifecycle of stars in nearby starburst systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational interaction between the Milky Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) perturbs the MW halo's density and kinematics, encoding information about both galaxies' masses and structures. We present a suite of 2,848 high-resolution ($10^7$ particles) N-body simulations that systematically vary the mass and shape of both galaxies' haloes. We model how the mean velocities and velocity dispersions of halo stars (30--120 kpc) depend on system parameters, and forecast constraints achievable with current and future observations. Assuming Gaia DR3-level astrometry, 20 km/s radial velocity precision, 10% distance precision, and a sample of $\sim$4,000 RR Lyrae stars, we achieve 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of $0.11 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$ in MW mass, $2.33 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ in LMC mass, 2.38 in halo concentration ($c$), and 0.06 in halo flattening ($q$). These correspond to fractional uncertainties of 11%, 16%, 25%, and 6% respectively, relative to fiducial values. Improved Gaia proper motions (DR5) yield modest gains (up to 14%), while adding radial velocities improves constraints by up to 60% relative to using Gaia astrometry alone. Doubling the sample size to $\sim$8,000 stars yields an additional 30% improvement, whereas reducing distance uncertainties has minimal impact ($\le$10%). Mean velocities trace LMC-induced perturbations, while velocity dispersions constrain MW halo properties, jointly breaking degeneracies. Our results demonstrate that combining Gaia astrometry with large spectroscopic surveys will enable precise characterization of the MW-LMC system. This methodology paper establishes the framework for interpreting observations; future work will apply these tools to existing spectroscopic datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational potential of the Milky Way encodes information about the distribution of all matter -- including dark matter -- throughout the Galaxy. Gaia data release 3 has revealed a complex structure that necessitates flexible models of the Galactic gravitational potential. We make use of a sample of 5.6 million upper-main-sequence stars to map the full 3D gravitational potential in a one-kiloparsec radius from the Sun using a data-driven approach called ``Deep Potential''. This method makes minimal assumptions about the dynamics of the Galaxy -- that the stars are a collisionless system that is statistically stationary in a rotating frame (with pattern speed to be determined). We model the distribution of stars in 6D phase space using a normalizing flow and the gravitational network using a neural network. We recover a local pattern speed of $\Omega_p = 28.2\pm0.1\mathrm{\,km/s/kpc}$, a local total matter density of $\rho=0.086\pm0.010\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$ and local dark matter density of $\rho_\mathrm{DM}=0.007\pm0.011\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$. The full 3D model exhibits spatial fluctuations, which may stem from the model architecture and non-stationarity in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to map the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in emission by targeting ultraviolet emission lines, which trace the 10^4 - 10^6 K gas engaged in the feedback and accretion mechanisms driving galaxy evolution. While the CGM-galaxy connection is clearly evident through absorption line experiments and limited work done in optical and radio emission from the ground, the nature of this connection is poorly understood with regard to how these cosmic ecosystems exchange matter and energy. We outline a two-pronged experiment with Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) utilizing both multi-object spectroscopy to map kpc-scale CGM structures such as galactic superwinds and integral field spectroscopy to unveil the sub-kpc-scale processes such as thermal instabilities, which are theorized to govern the cool gas reservoirs long detected in pencil-beam absorption surveys. This article is an adaptation of a science case document developed by HWO's CGM/IGM Working Group.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD), together with the Nuclear Stellar Cluster and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, forms the central region of the Milky Way. Galactic X-ray background emission is known to be associated with the old stellar population, predominantly produced by accreting white dwarfs. In this work we characterize the X-ray emission of the Galactic Center (GC) region using wide-field observations with the ART-XC telescope on board the SRG observatory in the 4-12 keV energy band. Our analysis demonstrates that the X-ray emission of the GC at a spatial scale of a few hundred parsecs is dominated by the regularly shaped NSD aligned in the Galactic plane, and characterized by latitudinal and longitudinal scale heights of approximately 20 pc and approximately 100 pc, respectively. The measured flux, 6.8 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 4-12 keV band, corresponds to a luminosity of 5.9 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^36 erg/s, assuming the GC distance of 8.178 kpc. The average mass-normalized X-ray emissivity of the NSD, 5.6 (+0.5, -0.7) x 10^27 erg/s/M_sun, exceeds the corresponding value of the Galactic ridge by a factor of 3.3 (+0.4, -0.5), confirming other studies. We also perform a deprojection of the observed NSD surface brightness distribution in order to construct a three-dimensional X-ray luminosity density model, which can be directly compared to the existing three-dimensional stellar mass models. The emissivity of the NSD as a function of distance to Sgr A* reveals a centrally concentrated maximum, indicating an enhanced radiative output per unit stellar mass in the inner NSD region. Finally, we conclude that the observed spatial properties of the NSD are fully consistent with the stellar mass density distribution, leaving only a small room for a possible diffuse component.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of cosmology surveys will probe the matter distribution of the universe to unparalleled precision. To match this level of precision in cosmological parameter estimation, we need to use information at small scales of $\sim$ 1 Mpc, which requires an accurate model of baryonic feedback. In this paper, we employ the Dark Matter + Baryon (DMB) model, a flexible halo model that is well-fit to various hydrodynamical simulations, to extract information on baryonic feedback from galaxy cluster observables. Using a sample of thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) selected galaxy clusters from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) - with masses calibrated via weak lensing from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) - we develop a robust end-to-end pipeline that directly models the calibrated observables. Our analysis demonstrates that the tSZ Y-M relation can constrain several DMB model parameters, providing key insights into baryonic feedback effects on cosmic shear at the several percent level. We find a preference for intermediate to strong levels of feedback, which is both consistent with several hydrodynamic simulations and competitive with similar analyses performed on complementary probes. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of current and upcoming cosmic shear surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Constraining neutrino mass through cosmological observations relies on precise simulations to calibrate their effects on large scale structure, while these simulations must overcome computational challenges like dealing with large velocity dispersions and small intrinsic neutrino perturbations. We present an efficient N-body implementation with semi-linear neutrino mass response which gives accurate power spectra and halo statistics. We explore the necessity of correcting the expansion history caused by massive neutrinos and the transition between relativistic and non-relativistic components. The above method of including neutrino masses is built into the memory-, scalability-, and precision-optimized parallel N-body simulation code CUBE 2.0. Through a suite of neutrino simulations, we precisely quantify the neutrino mass effects on the nonlinear matter power spectra and halo statistics.
#### Delensing CMB B-modes using galaxy surveys: the effect of galaxy bias and matter clustering non-linearities

 - **Abstract**
 The B-mode of polarization of the CMB is a uniquely powerful probe of gravitational waves produced in the very early Universe. But searches for primordial B-mode anisotropies must contend with gravitational lensing, which induces late-time B-modes not associated with gravitational waves. These lensing B-modes can be removed -- i.e., delensed -- using observations of the E-modes and a proxy of the matter fluctuations along the line of sight that caused the deflections. The number density and redshift reach of galaxy surveys such as the upcoming Rubin observatory offer attractive prospects for using them to delens B-mode data from CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD or CMB-S4. However, stochasticity and non-linear galaxy bias may in principle decorrelate the galaxy field from the matter distribution responsible for the lensing effect, thus hindering efforts to delens B-modes. In addition, non-linear gravitational evolution and bias introduce non-Gaussianities in the large-scale structure which further complicate the modelling. We quantify these effects by populating an N-body simulation with a magnitude-limited, photometric sample of galaxies similar to Rubin's gold selection, and using them to delens CMB maps lensed by the same matter distribution. We find that pipelines that treat the galaxy overdensity as a Gaussian field will incur negligible bias on the inferred tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. Moreover, we show that even in a highly conservative scenario where only the linear bias of the galaxies can be determined, the bias on r arising from this simplification is well within statistical uncertainties for a cosmic-variance limited scenario where Rubin-like galaxies are used for delensing.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a deep neutral hydrogen (Hi) observation of the early-type galaxy NGC 2768 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Leveraging the high sensitivity of FAST, we discover an extended gas envelope around NGC 2768. The total Hi mass is measured to be 8.1 x 10^8 M_sun , representing a magnitude increase compared to previous Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) studies. Position-velocity (PV) diagram indicates the envelope mainly involves two components: an Hi disk of NGC 2768 and a newly discovered satellite galaxy without detectable counterparts in currently deep optical surveys. The center of the gas disk is mis-aligned with the optical disk of NGC 2768, with more gas redshifted, indicating it has been disturbed. Our study indicates NGC 2768 is currently undergoing a transition from a spiral galaxy to an S0. Previous deep WSRT observations reveal two dense clumps (named as Clumps A and Clump B throughout this paper) in the center of the envelope. We find Clump A corresponds to the densest part of the disk, while Clump B might be a newly discovered satellite galaxy which probably collided NGC 2768 about 0.38 Gyr ago. We also find tidal interactions between Clump B and PGC 2599651, NGC 2768 and UGC 4808. Based on these new findings, we finally analyze hierarchical accretion history of NGC 2768.
#### On the interpretation of XRISM X-ray measurements of turbulence in the intracluster medium: a comparison with cosmological simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether the properties of turbulent gas motions recently measured via X-ray spectroscopy in the Coma cluster of galaxies by XRISM are in tension with the "classical" fluid picture of the intracluster medium on large scales, as produced by a typical high-resolution cosmological simulation. We use a high-resolution simulation of Coma-like cluster of galaxies and show that the Kolmogorov-like turbulence measured in the simulation yields to velocity structure functions and line-width that fully compatible with those measured by the XRISM observation of Coma. These results highlight the combined biases driven by the inhomogeneity of turbulence in the intracluster medium and by the X-ray weighting in observations, and appear to release the tension between the XRISM data and current numerical simulations, showing that a turbulent spectrum much steeper than Kolmogorov is not required by current observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 20 Milky Way (MW), 9 Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), 7 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), 12 M31, and 7 M33 (classical) Cepheids with periods longer than 50 days were constructed using photometric data from the literature and fitted with model atmospheres with the aim of identifying objects with an infrared excess. The SEDs were fitted with stellar photosphere models to derive the best-fitting luminosity and effective temperature; a dust component was added when required. The distance and reddening values were taken from the literature. WISE and IRAC images were inspected to verify whether potential excess emission was related to the central objects. Only one star with a significant infrared (IR) excess was found in the LMC and none in the SMC, M31, and M33, contrary to earlier work on the MW suggesting that IR excess may be more prominent in MW Cepheids than in the Magellanic Clouds. One additional object in the MW was found to have an IR excess, but it is unclear whether it is a classical Cepheid or a type-{\sc ii} Cepheid. The stars were plotted in a Hertzsprung--Russell diagram (HRD) and compared to evolutionary tracks for CCs and to theoretical instability strips. For the large majority of stars, the position in the HRD is consistent with the instability strip. For stars in the MW uncertainties in the distance and reddening can significantly change their position in the HRD.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows us to observe galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-15$) with unprecedented detail, revealing their morphologies, sizes, and internal structures. These observations offer crucial insights into the physical processes driving early galaxy formation. In this work, we introduce the Phoebos hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, a state-of-the-art 100 Mpc volume designed to study the formation and evolution of galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn and into the epoch of reionization. Phoebos includes a stellar feedback model that is intentionally weak, in order to address the high abundance of massive galaxies seen by JWST at early epochs. At variance with most large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we do not employ an effective equation of state model, instead our radiative cooling model allows us to capture the multi-phase nature of the gas inside and around galaxies. Phoebos reproduces key observables of early galaxy formation at $z \gtrsim 8$, including the stellar mass function and the stellar-to-halo mass relation. It also recovers the observed slope of the stellar size-to-mass relation and matches the specific star formation rate remarkably well. These results suggest that highly efficient star formation in the presence of only mild regulation from stellar feedback, drives early galaxy growth, supporting a scenario of rapid stellar mass assembly during cosmic dawn. There are indications in the cosmic star formation density that, at lower redshifts, Phoebos might overpredict the stellar mass within the systems, suggesting that a transition to a stronger stellar feedback may be necessary to reproduce later-time observations. These results highlight the potential of Phoebos to interpret JWST observations and to probe the evolving physical processes that shape galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present \texttt{COMPASS}, a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. \texttt{COMPASS} handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. % Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, \texttt{COMPASS} evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova\,Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. % Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine scale and redshift dependence of mass-property relations (MPRs) for five hot gas properties of two large group- and cluster-scale halo samples realized by the IllustrisTNG, TNG-Cluster and FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. For intrinsic properties of i) hot gas mass ($M_{\rm gas}$), ii) spectroscopic-like temperature ($T_{\rm sl}$), iii) soft-band X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and iv) X-ray ($Y_{\rm X}$) and v) Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ($Y_{\rm SZ}$) thermal energies, we use MPR parameters to infer mass proxy quality (MPQ) -- the implied scatter in total halo mass conditioned on a property -- for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} \geq 10^{13}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$ at redshifts, $z \in \{0, 0.5, 1, 2\}$. We find: (1) in general, scaling relation slopes and covariance display moderate to strong dependence on halo mass, with redshift dependence secondary, (2) for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} > 10^{14}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$, scalings of $M_{\rm gas}$ and $Y_{\rm SZ}$ simplify toward self-similar slope and constant intrinsic scatter (5 and 10%, respectively) nearly independent of scale, making both measures ideal for cluster finding and characterization to $z=2$, (3) halo mass-conditioned likelihoods of hot gas mass and thermal energy at fixed halo mass closely follow a log-normal form, (4) despite normalization differences ranging up to $0.4$ dex, there is good qualitative, and often quantitative, agreement between the scale-dependent slopes and property covariance of the two simulations. Slopes show appreciable redshift dependence at the group scale, while redshift dependence of the scatter is exhibited by low mass FLAMINGO halos only, (5) property correlations are largely consistent between the simulations, with values that mainly agree with existing empirical measurements. We close with a literature survey placing our MPR slopes and intrinsic scatter estimates into context.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the design for HALO7D-X, a survey of the stellar halo to investigate the accretion history of the Milky Way. The survey will use a combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Gaia data for sky position and proper motions of faint stars (18<G<21.5 mag), while line-of-sight velocity, distance, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] will be measured using follow-up Keck spectroscopy. The survey will cover 30 lines of sight, made up of multiple HST archival fields and optimized for Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy. We use mock survey observations of the Bullock and Johnston stellar halo simulations to investigate the sensitivity of HALO7D-X to constrain the basic parameters of the accretion history of our Galaxy's stellar halo. We find that we are sensitive to the mass distribution and accretion timeline of the stellar halo progenitors, but not their orbital circularity. We find that the simulated halos fall into three different groups based on the similarities in their distributions of the observable dimensions of our survey. These groups are also distinct from each other in the mass distribution and accretion timeline of their progenitor satellites, showing that by using similarities in our observables among halos, we are able to identify similarities in their accretion histories. With HALO7D-X we will compare real Milky Way data with simulated halos and use this connection between observables and progenitor mass and accretion timeline to learn about the formation of our Galaxy's stellar halo.
