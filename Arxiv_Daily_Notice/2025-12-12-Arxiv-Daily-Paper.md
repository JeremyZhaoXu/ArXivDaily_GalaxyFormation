 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of high redshift galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope suggest the presence of a bright population of galaxies that is more abundant than predicted by most galaxy formation models. These observations have led to a rethinking of these models, and numerous astrophysical and cosmological solutions have been proposed, including cosmic strings, topological defects that may be remnants of a specific phase transition in the very early moments of the Universe. In this paper, we integrate cosmic strings, a source of nonlinear and non-Gaussian perturbations, into the semi analytical code Zeus21, allowing us to efficiently predict the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF). We conduct a precise study of parameter degeneracies between star-formation astrophysics and cosmic-string phenomenology. Our results suggest that cosmic strings can boost the early-galaxy abundance enough to explain the measured UVLFs from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes from redshift z = 4 to z = 17 without modifying the star-formation physics. In addition, we set a new upper bound on the string tension of $G\mu \lessapprox 10^{-8}$ ($95\%$ credibility), improving upon previous limits from the cosmic microwave background. Although with current data there is some level of model and prior dependence to this limit, it suggests that UVLFs are a promising avenue for future observational constraints on cosmic-string physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar orbits in the Galactic disc evolve from their birth to the current shape through both radial migration and dynamical heating. The history of their secular evolution is imprinted in the current kinematics and age-metallicity distribution. We construct a chrono-chemo-dynamical model of the disc, incorporating inside-out growth, metallicity evolution, radial migration, and heating to fit the observed age-metallicity-kinematics distribution of LAMOST subgiant stars in both the low and high-$\alpha$ disc. By modelling all distribution parameters with spline fitting, we present the first non-parametric stellar migration and heating history of the Galaxy. We determine the heating-to-migration ratio, the ratio of the root-mean-square changes in radial/vertical and azimuthal actions, to be $\approx0.075$ for radial to azimuthal actions and $\approx0.015$ for vertical to azimuthal actions, implying a highly anisotropic diffusion in the action space. Furthermore, we identify a transition in radial migration efficiency coinciding with the transition moment of the bimodal disc, for which the radial migration was more efficient for the high-$\alpha$ disc than for the low-$\alpha$ disc. This transition may be attributed to two correlated scenarios: 1) a bar formation epoch accompanied by violent outward migration, and 2) a drop in the gas mass fraction in the disc when the low-$\alpha$ disc began to form. These findings offer further constraints on the formation mechanisms of bimodal discs, favouring the downsizing scenario. We also briefly discuss the connection between our results and recent high-redshift observations. In addition to the secular evolution history, our model maps the Milky Way ISM metallicity gradient at different lookback times, which we find has only varied a little (in the range of $-0.07~\rm to~-0.10~dex/kpc$) since disc formation.
#### ClearPotential: Revealing Local Dark Matter in Three Dimensions

 - **Abstract**
 We present ClearPotential, a data-driven, three-dimensional measurement of the gravitational potential of the local Milky Way using unsupervised machine learning, without the symmetry assumptions, specific functional forms, and binning required in previous work. The potential is modeled as a neural network, optimized to solve the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation for the observed phase space density of Gaia DR3 Red Clump stars within 4 kpc of the Sun. This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center. We determine the dark matter density at the Solar radius to be $(0.84 \pm 0.08)\times 10^{-2}\,{M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$, and analyze the structure of the dark matter halo. We find strong evidence for a tilted oblate halo, weak preference for a cored inner profile, and the strongest constraints to date on a possible dark matter disk. We place a bound on the timescale of disequilibrium in the local Milky Way, and find mild evidence for disequilibrium using independent acceleration measurements from timings of binary pulsar systems. This work provides the clearest map of the local Galactic potential to date and marks an important step in the era of data-driven astrometry.

 - **Abstract**
 We present argon abundances from a sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at $z=2-3.5$ from the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-Optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) program. Although argon is an $\alpha-$element produced by Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe), the latest supernova yield models suggest additional argon production and enrichment by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), unlike other $\alpha-$elements such as oxygen. To study the relationship between argon and oxygen abundances, we construct two median-stacked composite spectra for separate $z=2.0-2.6$ and $z=2.8-3.5$ redshift bins, presenting more representative measurements than previous samples that require individual detection of faint lines. Abundance ratios were determined using an empirical calibration based on the strength of the [ArIII]$\lambda7137$ emission line relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5008$ emission line. With this calibration, we estimate argon abundances (Ar/O) of $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 2.26$ bin and $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.11}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 3.15$ bin, suggesting minimal SNe Ia and dominant CCSNe enrichment in this sample. Comparison of our abundance measurements of $z\sim 2-3$ AURORA galaxies with chemical evolution modeling of Milky Way stars shows consistency with the Milky Way Bulge component, suggesting a rapid star-formation timescale. However, even larger samples of actively star-forming galaxies with available argon abundances, as well as comparisons between argon abundance and other critical galaxy properties (e.g., sSFR) and models (e.g., one tuned specifically to this redshift range) are needed to draw stronger conclusions on the role of argon in galactic chemical enrichment at Cosmic Noon.

 - **Abstract**
 Semi-analytic models are a widely used approach to simulate galaxy properties within a cosmological framework, relying on simplified yet physically motivated prescriptions. They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $\Omega_{\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference.

 - **Abstract**
 We present FEADME (Fast Elliptical Accretion Disk Modeling Engine), a GPU-accelerated Python framework for modeling broad Balmer-line emission using a relativistic elliptical accretion-disk formalism. Leveraging Jax and NumPyro for differentiable forward modeling and efficient Bayesian inference, FEADME enables large-sample, reproducible analyses of disk-dominated emission-line profiles. We apply the framework to 237 double-peaked emitters (DPEs) from the literature and to five tidal disruption events (TDEs) with disk-like H$\alpha$ emission, fitting three physically motivated model families per spectrum and selecting the preferred model using approximate leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. We find that AGN exhibit a broad, continuous distribution of disk geometries and kinematics, with significant diversity in disk parameters. Most TDE disk parameter distributions are statistically indistinguishable from those of the AGN, with the sole robust difference being that TDE disks are significantly more circular, consistent with rapid debris circularization in tidal disruption events. The majority of both AGN and TDEs favor models that include both a disk and an additional broad-line component, suggesting that disk emission commonly coexists with more isotropic or wind-driven gas. These results indicate that once a line-emitting disk forms, its spectroscopic appearance is governed by similar physical processes in both persistent AGN and transient TDE accretion flows, and they demonstrate the utility of FEADME for population-level studies of disk structure in galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have already produced tens of strong candidate flares, and their number will greatly increase with upcoming wide field surveys. Nevertheless, the origin of the measured luminosity peak at early times is still unknown, and the ultimate sources of energy dissipation in TDEs are not fully understood. Here we present the first three-dimensional end-to-end simulation of a TDE by a $10^{4}M_\odot$ intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) with realistic parameters, run with the radiation-hydrodynamics code RICH. We find that the stellar debris fails to circularize efficiently, while a low-density, radiation-driven wind forms near pericenter and expands quasi-spherically. Radiation is advected by this outflow and released at the photosphere, which expands to radii of $\approx10^{13}$ cm and reaches temperatures of ~few $10^{4}$K at the peak of the light curve. The resulting luminosity briefly exceeds the Eddington limit before settling near that value. We systematically test the numerical convergence of our simulation by running it at three resolutions. While the nozzle shock at pericenter may be under-resolved, we find that global results are qualitatively converged and, largely, quantitatively robust. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST (g and r band) and ULTRASAT (near UV) will be able to observe events like our simulated IMBH TDE up to redshifts of z$\approx$0.1 and z$\approx$0.06, respectively.

 Context: Unresolved binaries in star clusters can bias stellar and cluster mass estimates, making their proper treatment essential for studying cluster dynamics and evolution. Aims: We aim to develop a fast and robust framework for jointly deriving stellar masses and multiplicity statistics of member stars, together with optimal cluster parameters. Methods: We use Gaia DR3 parallaxes together with multi-band photometry of open cluster (OC) members to infer stellar masses and binary mass-ratios through simulation-based inference (SBI), while iteratively fitting the cluster parameters. The validation of our SBI framework on simulated clusters demonstrates that the inclusion of infrared photometry significantly improves the detection of low mass-ratio binaries. The minimum mass-ratio threshold for reliably identifying unresolved binaries depends on cluster properties and the available photometry, but typically lies below $q=0.5$. Results: Applying our method to 42 well-populated OCs, we derive a catalogue of stellar masses and mass-ratios for 27201 stars, achieving typical uncertainties of 0.08 in $q$ and $0.01\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in the primary stellar mass. We analyse the archetype OCs M67 and NGC 2360 in detail, including mass segregation and mass-ratio distribution among other characteristics, while deriving multiplicity fractions for the rest of the sample. We find evidence that the high mass-ratio ($q\geq 0.6$) binary fraction shows a strong correlation with the age and a weak anti-correlation with the cluster metallicity. Furthermore, the variation of the binary fraction with stellar mass in OCs shows strong accordance with the observed dependence for field stars heavier than $\gtrsim0.6\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Conclusions: Our work paves a path for future population-level investigations of multiplicity statistics and precision stellar masses in extended samples of OCs.
#### OutLines: Modeling Spectral Lines from Winds, Bubbles, and Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Common methods for studying the kinematics and geometry of outflowing gas rely on modeling emission and absorption lines in integrated spectra using methods that are not physically motivated, including empirical quantiles or fitting multiple Gaussian or Voigt profiles. Such methods are not always consistent with the interpretation of these features and, as a result, miss key underlying physics and can even lead to inaccurate interpretations of observations. To address this problem, we present the publicly available python code OutLines, which provides astrophysical models of spectral emission and absorption line profiles produced by outflows in a variety of environments. The OutLines code accounts for differences in parameterization of the velocity field and density profile while allowing for different outflow geometries, making OutLines versatile and useful for a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. We demonstrate the wide applicability of OutLines by using the code to model line profiles in an H II region knot, super star clusters, a starburst galaxy, and an AGN. In each of these contexts, we illustrate how OutLines can illuminate key underlying physics in ways that improve our scientific understanding and address important open questions in astronomy, including the key mechanisms in the baryon cycle, the evolution of H II regions and galaxies, and even Lyman continuum escape. OutLines will be a critical resource as massively multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like WEAVE-LOFAR and 4MOST/WAVES come online, providing the means to probe feedback kinematics with deeper, higher resolution spectroscopy for unprecedented large samples of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are typically discovered in previously quiescent galaxies. However, earlier studies have revealed a handful of TDEs occurring in pre-existing active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We discuss AT2019aalc, a promising TDE candidate in an AGN, and compare it to similar sources. We also explore Bowen fluorescence flares, a newly identified class of flaring supermassive black holes, as potential members of the TDE in AGN transient class. We aim to connect the observed properties of these flares with the expectations of TDE-in-AGN simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way (MW) are useful for testing models of the formation of our Galaxy, and by extension various theories of cosmology. Recent efforts to measure the masses of the MW's satellite dwarf galaxies have relied on the motions and positions of stars in the MW's disk and halo, which are perturbed by the passage of satellite galaxies. As there are many known processes in our Galaxy that lead to observed disequilibrium in stars, these kinematic methods have been limited by the inherent difficulty in identifying only the perturbations due to particular satellite galaxies. We present a novel method for determining the masses of two MW satellite galaxies -- the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Sgr dSph) -- using only direct, instantaneous acceleration data derived from extremely precise timing of millisecond pulsars near the Sun. As the LMC and Sgr dSph orbit the MW, they cause wave-like distortions in the structure of the disk plus a large-scale offset in the centers of mass of the dark matter halo and the baryonic disk. These two effects lead to asymmetric accelerations above and below the disk midplane near the Sun, which is observed in the pulsar acceleration data. Notably, the amplitude of this asymmetry is shown to depend on the masses of the orbiting satellites. We analyze a grid of simulations with varying masses of each satellite. We find the total (dark + baryon) mass enclosed within the tidal radius at the present day for the LMC to be 4.1 $\pm$ 1.0 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ within a radius of 16.6 kpc, and for Sgr to be 3.5 $\pm$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^8$ M$_\odot$ within a radius of 5 kpc. These results are generally consistent and competitive with previous determinations of the masses of these objects, but entirely independent of any stellar kinematic data for the first time.
#### The LISA Astrophysics "Disc-IMRI" Code Comparison Project: Intermediate-Mass-Ratio Binaries in AGN-Like Discs

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, will be sensitive to extreme- and intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs and IMRIs). These binaries are comprised of a supermassive black hole and a stellar-mass object or intermediate-mass black hole. Their detection will probe the structure of galactic nuclei and enable tests of general relativity. As these events will be observed over thousands of orbital cycles, they will be extremely sensitive to both the underlying spacetime and astrophysical environment, demanding exquisite theoretical models on both fronts to avoid biased or even erroneous results. In particular, many (E/)IMRIs are expected to occur within accretion discs around supermassive black holes, and the nonlinearities present when modeling these systems require numerical simulations. In preparation for future modeling of LISA sources, we have conducted a comparison between eight different hydrodynamical codes and applied them to the problem of a q = 10^{-4} mass ratio binary interacting with an accretion disc. Thicker discs appear more lenient, and all codes at sufficiently high resolutions are in good agreement with each other and analytical predictions. For thinner discs, beyond the reach of analytical models, we find substantial disagreement between 2D and 3D simulations and between different codes, including both the magnitude and sign of the torque. With time and energy efficiency in mind, codes that leverage moving meshes or grid-based Lagrangian remapping seem preferable, as do codes that can leverage graphical processing units and other energy-efficient hardware.
#### Signatures of star formation inside galactic outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have suggested that galactic outflows contain substantial amounts of dense and clumpy molecular gas, creating favourable conditions for igniting star formation. Indeed, theoretical models and hydrodynamical simulations have suggested that stars could form within galactic outflows, representing a new mode of star-formation that differs significantly from the typical star formation in star forming discs. In this paper, we examine 12 local galaxies with powerful Active Galactic Nuclei and high star-formation rate using spectroscopic data from the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. We investigate the excitation mechanism and physical properties of these outflows via spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams (along with tests to rule out contribution by shocks and external photoionisation). Out of the seven galaxies with clearly detected outflows, we find robust evidence for star formation within the outflow of one galaxy (IRAS 20551-4250), with two additional galaxies showing tentative signs (IRAS 13120-5453 and F13229-2934). Therefore, our findings support previous results that star formation inside outflows can be a relatively common phenomenon among these active galaxies and may have played an important role in the formation and evolution of the spheroidal component of galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first robust evidence for the rotational kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (rkSZ) effect, produced by the Thomson scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons off rotating intracluster gas. By combining CMB intensity and polarization measurements from the $\it{Planck}$ satellite with spectroscopic member-galaxy redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in a sample of 25 X-ray cross-matched, low-redshift ($0.02< z< 0.09)$, massive ($10^{13.9}\lesssim M_{\rm 500c}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{14.6}$) galaxy clusters, we detect a dipolar rkSZ signature aligned with the estimated rotation direction of each cluster, ruling out a chance fluctuation at 99.98% confidence (3.6$\sigma$). The significance of this measurement is enhanced by several new methodological improvements for isolating the rkSZ signal from primary CMB fluctuations and noise. The amplitude and shape of the signal are qualitatively consistent with predictions from state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations. These results establish a new tool with which to probe the dynamical state of galaxy clusters using CMB data.
