### Today: 9papers

 - **Abstract**
 Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centers of most galaxies today, over 300 have now been discovered at $z >$ 6, including a $4 \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ BH in UHZ1 at $z = 10.1$ and an $8\times10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ BH in GHZ9 at $z =$ 10.4. They are thought to form when 10$^4$ - 10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$ primordial stars die as direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) at $z \sim$ 20 - 25. While studies have shown that DCBHs should be visible at birth at $z \gtrsim$ 20 in the near infrared (NIR) to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), none have considered SMBH detections at later stages growth down to $z \sim$ 6 - 7. Here, we present continuum NIR luminosities for a quasar like ULAS J1120+0641, a $1.35 \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ BH at $z =$ 7.1, from a cosmological simulation for Euclid, Roman Space Telescope (RST) and JWST bands from $z =$ 6 - 15. We find that Euclid and RST could detect such BHs, including others like UHZ1 and GHZ9, at much earlier stages of evolution, out to $z \sim$ 14 - 15, and that their redshifts could be confirmed spectroscopically with JWST. Synergies between these three telescopes could thus reveal the numbers of quasars at much higher redshifts and discriminate between their formation channels because Euclid and RST can capture large numbers of them in wide-field surveys for further study by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The clustering of dark-matter halos depends primarily on halo mass. However, at fixed halo mass, numerical simulations have revealed multiple secondary dependencies. This so-called secondary halo bias has important implications for our understanding of structure formation and observational cosmology. Despite its significance, the effect has not yet been measured observationally with statistical confidence. Aims. We aim to develop the first observational method to probe halo spin bias: the secondary dependence of halo clustering on halo spin at fixed halo mass. Methods. We use a proxy for halo spin based on the coherent motion of galaxies within and around a halo. This technique is tested using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation and subsequently applied to a group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By splitting the SDSS groups according to this spin proxy and measuring the two-point correlation function of the resulting samples, the existence of halo spin bias is investigated. Results. We find consistent indications that, at fixed mass, groups with higher values of the spin proxy exhibit higher bias than those with lower spin proxy values, on scales of 5-15 ${h}^{-1}$$\mathrm{Mpc}$. The highest significance is seen for groups with halo masses ${M}_{\rm h} \gtrsim {10}^{13.2}$ ${h}^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$, for which 85$\%$ of the sampled measurements display the expected trend. As we continue to improve the method, our results could open new avenues for studying the connection between halo spin and the large-scale structure with upcoming spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Magellan/IMACS and Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy of the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy Pictor~II (Pic~II) that is located only 12 kpc from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). From the IMACS spectroscopy, we identify 13 member stars and measure a mean heliocentric velocity of $326.9\pm1.1~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a velocity dispersion of $3.5_{-0.9}^{+1.1}~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a mean metallicity of $\overline{\rm [Fe/H]}=-2.99\pm0.06$, and an upper limit on the metallicity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]}<0.18$. We measure detailed elemental abundances for the brightest star, finding $\mbox{[Fe/H]} = -3.3$, high [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, and no detectable neutron capture elements, similar to stars in other UFDs. However, this star has an unusually high [Sc/Fe] ratio. The dynamical mass-to-light ratio ($M/L=760_{-420}^{+910}~M_{\odot}~L^{-1}_{\odot}$), size, and chemical abundances confirms that Pic~II is a dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy. We perform detailed orbit modeling of Pic~II in a combined Milky Way (MW) and LMC potential and find that Pic~II is highly likely to be a long-term LMC satellite. Furthermore, we find that Pic II is likely still bound to the LMC today. Pic~II is the seventh LMC-associated UFD and among the most metal-poor UFDs known. We further update the morphological parameters with deeper Dark Energy Camera (DECam) photometry, compute the dark matter properties for dark matter indirect detection searches, verify the extremely low metallicity with narrowband CaHK imaging, and briefly discuss tidal influences of the LMC and MW.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on high-resolution near-infrared photometric data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) targeting the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), this study attempts to evaluate the feasibility and sensitivity limits of variable star detection in crowded stellar fields. Through light curve analysis, we identified a total of 304 periodic variable stars, including 71 EW-type eclipsing binaries, 7 EA-type eclipsing binaries, 177 rotational variables, 38 $\delta$ Scuti (DSCT) stars, and 12 RR Lyrae stars. Period--luminosity relations (PLRs) were derived for EW-type eclipsing binaries, DSCT stars, and RR Lyrae stars. The PLRs for EW-type and RR Lyrae stars are in good agreement with previous studies, while the PLR zero point for DSCT stars appears systematically fainter by approximately 0.15--0.30 mag. Our PLRs exhibit low dispersion and are minimally affected by crowding. We analyzed the capability of JWST archival data to detect low-amplitude variables and found that only stars with amplitudes greater than approximately 0.05 mag can be reliably detected. Through simulations, we quantified how increasing the number of photometric epochs improves the detectability of low-amplitude, low signal-to-noise ratio variables. Despite current limitations in observational cadence, JWST demonstrates unique advantages in detecting short-period eclipsing binaries, rotational variables, and high-amplitude pulsators. Its exceptional spatial resolution enables high-precision PLR calibrations, offering new opportunities for future studies in variable star astrophysics and extragalactic distance measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Millimeter galaxy surveys are particularly effective in detecting dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshift. While such observations are typically conducted at ~1mm, studies suggest that 2mm may be better suited for selecting sources at even higher redshifts. We use the unprecedented 2mm data from the N2CLS, together with the SIDES simulation, to study and interpret the statistical properties of 2mm-selected galaxies. We use the N2CLS robust sample at 2mm, which contains 25 sources in the deep GOODS-N field and 90 sources in the wide COSMOS. The sources are matched with the N2CLS 1.2mm sources, the ancillary 850um sources, and redshift catalogs to study the colors and redshift distributions. We also produce end-to-end simulations based on SIDES and the observed N2CLS detector timelines to interpret the data. We find a mean S2/S1.2 color of 0.215$\pm$0.006 with a standard deviation of 0.056$\pm$0.004. We measure a mean redshift of $3.6\pm0.3$ in GOODS-N, which is marginally higher than expectations from SIDES ($3.0\pm0.2$) because of an overdensity at $z\sim5.2$, and $3.0\pm0.2$ in COSMOS, which agrees with the $3.2\pm0.2$ predicted by SIDES. We also show that the observed S2/S1.2 colors exhibit a weak dependence with redshift but a large dispersion, which limits its efficiency to select high-z sources. Finally, we studied the nine 2mm sources not detected at 1.2mm, and found that two of them are radiogalaxies, one is a z~2 galaxy, and the remaining six are compatible with the expected number of spurious detections. The N2CLS survey shows no evidence for any exotic 2mm-only galaxy population. Using SIDES, we show that 2mm samples have a higher mean redshift compared to 1.2mm because they miss z~2 dusty galaxies. Finally, we compare the N2CLS with the ex-MORA survey and show that N2CLS is more efficient than interferometric observations to build samples of high-z dusty galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe), though rare, are exceptionally valuable probes for cosmology and astrophysics. Upcoming time-domain surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) offer a major opportunity to discover them in large numbers. Early identification is crucial for timely follow-up observations. We develop a deep learning pipeline to detect LSNe using multi-band, multi-epoch image cutouts. Our model is based on a 2D convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM2D) architecture, designed to capture both spatial and temporal correlations in time-series imaging data. Predictions are made after each observation in the time series, with accuracy improving as more data arrive. We train the model on realistic simulations derived from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data, which closely matches LSST in depth and filters. This work focuses exclusively on Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). LSNe Ia are injected onto HSC luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at various phases of evolution to create positive examples. Negative examples include variable sources from HSC Transient Survey (including unclassified transients), and simulated unlensed SNe Ia in LRG and spiral galaxies. Our multi-band model shows rapid classification improvements during the initial few observations and quickly reaches high detection efficiency: at a fixed false-positive rate (FPR) of $0.01\%$, the true-positive rate (TPR) reaches $\gtrsim 60\%$ by the 7th observation and exceeds $\gtrsim 70\%$ by the 9th. Among the negative examples, SNe in LRGs remain the primary source of FPR, as they can resemble their lensed counterparts under certain conditions. The model detects quads more effectively than doubles and performs better on systems with larger image separations. Although trained and tested on HSC-like data, our approach applies to any cadenced imaging survey, particularly LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the accuracy and range of validity of the perturbative model for the 2-point (2PCF) and 3-point (3PCF) correlation functions in real space in view of the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid mission spectroscopic sample. We take advantage of clustering measurements from four snapshots of the Flagship I N-body simulations at z = {0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8}, which mimic the expected galaxy population in the ideal case of absence of observational effects such as purity and completeness. For the 3PCF we consider all available triangle configurations given a minimal separation. First, we assess the model performance by fixing the cosmological parameters and evaluating the goodness-of-fit provided by the perturbative bias expansion in the joint analysis of the two statistics, finding overall agreement with the data down to separations of 20 Mpc/h. Subsequently, we build on the state-of-the-art and extend the analysis to include the dependence on three cosmological parameters: the amplitude of scalar perturbations As, the matter density {\omega}cdm and the Hubble parameter h. To achieve this goal, we develop an emulator capable of generating fast and robust modelling predictions for the two summary statistics, allowing efficient sampling of the joint likelihood function. We therefore present the first joint full-shape analysis of the real-space 2PCF and 3PCF, testing the consistency and constraining power of the perturbative model across both probes, and assessing its performance in a combined likelihood framework. We explore possible systematic uncertainties induced by the perturbative model at small scales finding an optimal scale cut of rmin = 30 Mpc/h for the 3PCF, when imposing an additional limitation on nearly isosceles triangular configurations included in the data vector. This work is part of a Euclid Preparation series validating theoretical models for galaxy clustering.
#### Modeling the Mass Distribution and Gravitational Potential of Nearby Disk Galaxies: Implications for the ISM Dynamical Equilibrium

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize stellar, gas, and dark matter mass distributions for 17 nearby massive disk galaxies from the PHANGS sample. This allows us to compute the gravitational potential that vertically confines the interstellar gas and determines its equilibrium scale height and weight. We first combine dynamical mass constraints from existing CO and HI rotation curves together with stellar and gas mass estimates from near-infrared, CO, and HI data. These estimates incorporate current best practices in modeling stellar mass-to-light ratios and CO-to-H2 conversion factor variations. Then, we fit joint stellar--gas--dark matter mass models to the rotation curves, adopting the classic maximal disk assumption to account for remaining zero-point uncertainties on the stellar mass-to-light ratio. After obtaining three-component radial mass profiles, we calculate the vertical equilibrium gas scale height and ISM weight in the combined gravitational potential. We find the gas scale height $H_\text{gas}$ increases from ${\lesssim}100$pc in the inner disks to ${>}500$pc at large radii, consistent with observations of our Galaxy and other edge-on galaxies. The gas weight is dominated by stellar gravity at small radii, but the gas and dark matter gravity often become important beyond 3-6 times the stellar disk radial scale length. Both our gas scale height and weight estimates are dependent on the treatment of stellar disk scale height $H_\star$, with $H_\text{gas}$ varying by 30-40% when $H_\star$ varies by a factor of 3. The relationship between our refined ISM weight estimates and local star formation surface density generally agrees with previous observations and predictions from theory and simulations.
#### Gravitational redshift from large-scale structure: nonlinearities, anti-symmetries, and the dipole

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational redshift imprints a slight asymmetry in the observed clustering of galaxies, producing odd multipoles (e.g.\ the dipole) in the cross-correlation function. But there are other sources of asymmetry which must also be considered in any model which aims to measure gravitational redshift from large-scale structure. In this work we develop a nonlinear model of the redshift-space correlation function complete down to these subleading, asymmetric effects. In addition to gravitational redshift and the well-known redshift-space distortions, our model, given by a compact nonperturbative formula, also accounts for wide-angle effects (to all orders), lightcone effects, and other kinematic contributions. We compare our model with $N$-body simulations and find good agreement; in particular we find that the observed turnover in the dipole moment around a separation of $20\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ (a feature absent in the linear predictions) is well accounted for. By examining the exchange properties of distinct tracers, we identify the pairwise potential difference as the key physical ingredient of the dipole. Several new insights related to the theory of redshift-space distortions are also given.
