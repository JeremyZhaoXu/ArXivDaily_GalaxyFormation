 - **Abstract**
 Rest-frame optical observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a population of massive galaxies, exceeding $10^{10}$ solar masses, present less than a billion years after the Big Bang. The large stellar masses of these galaxies require an efficient conversion of baryons into stars, which may exceed theoretical expectations. However, the formation process of massive galaxies so early in the Universe's history is perplexing, as observations provide limited information to constrain their evolutionary pathways. Here, we present multi-wavelength observations of a galaxy complex consisting of at least five galaxies within a $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ region, referred to as the \quintet, using JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This system, located in the core of a galaxy protocluster at approximately 650 million years after the Big Bang, reveals the detailed physical processes involved in the formation of massive galaxies. These processes include a dynamic cycles of merger induced gas stripping, leading the temporal termination of star formation, and recycling of the stripped gas, with subsequent enhancement of star formation in other galaxies of the system, which is expected to evolve into massive galaxies that host more than $10^{10}$ solar masses of stars. The new observations represent the first comprehensive evidence of a massive galaxy formation through gas-rich, multiple-galaxy mergers induced by a dense protocluster environment in the $650\,{\rm Myrs}$ after the Big Bang. Our results suggest that the protocluster core is indeed one of the main drivers of efficient galaxy formation and rapid evolution in the early Universe, as predicted by theoretical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies exhibit significant diversity at fixed halo mass, challenging galaxy formation within the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. Previous cosmological galaxy formation simulations with baryonic physics fail to reproduce the full diversity of rotation curves, suggesting either that there is a flaw in baryonic feedback models, or that an alternative to CDM must be invoked. In this work, we use the Marvelous Massive Dwarf zoom-in simulations, a suite of high-resolution dwarf simulations with $M_{200}~\sim 10^{10}-10^{11}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ and $M_{*}\sim 10^{7}-10^{9}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$, designed to target the mass range where galaxy rotation curve diversity is maximized, i.e., between $V_{\rm max} \sim 70-100~ {\rm km/s}$. We add to this a set of low-mass galaxies from the Marvel Dwarf Zoom Volumes to extend the galaxy mass range to lower values. Our fiducial star formation and feedback models produce simulated dwarfs with a broader range of rotation curve shapes, similar to observations. These are the first simulations that can both create dark matter cores via baryonic feedback, reproducing the slower rising rotation curves, while also allowing for compact galaxies and steeply rising rotation curves. Our simulated dwarfs also reproduce the observed size$-M_*$ relation, including scatter, producing both extended and compact dwarfs for the first time in simulated field dwarfs. We explore star formation and feedback models and conclude that previous simulations may have had feedback that was too strong to produce compact dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia phase spiral is considered to work as a dynamical clock for dating past perturbations, but most of the previous studies neglected the disc's self-gravity, potentially biasing estimates of the phase spiral's excitation time. We aim to evaluate the impact of self-gravitating effects on the evolution of vertical phase spirals and to quantify the bias introduced in estimating their excitation time when such effects are ignored. We analysed a high-resolution, self-consistent $N$-body simulation of the MW-Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) system, alongside four test particle simulations in potentials contracted from the $N$-body snapshots. In each case, we estimated the winding time of phase spirals by measuring the slope of the density contrast in the vertical angle-frequency space. In test particle models, the phase spiral begins winding immediately after Sgr's pericentre passage, and the winding time closely tracks the true elapsed time since the Sgr's pericentre passage. Adding the DM wake yields only a modest (< 100 Myr) reduction of the winding time relative to Sgr alone. By contrast, the self-consistent $N$-body simulation exhibits an initial, coherent vertical oscillation lasting $\gtrsim$ 300 Myr before a clear spiral forms, leading to systematic underestimation of excitation times. An analytical shearing-box model with self-gravity, developed by Widrow (2023), qualitatively reproduces this delay, supporting its origin in the disc's self-gravitating response. Assuming that self-gravity affects phase mixing in the MW to the same degree as the $N$-body model, the lag induced by self-gravity is estimated to be $\sim$ 0.3 Gyr in the solar neighbourhood. Accounting for this delay revises the inferred age of the MW's observed phase spiral to $\sim$0.6-1.2 Gyr, in better agreement with the Sgr's pericentre passage. (shortened for arXiv)

 - **Abstract**
 The center of the Milky Way is a unique environment of great astrophysical interest, but its extreme crowding and extinction make it difficult to study. The GALACTICNUCLEUS survey, a high-angular-resolution near-infrared imaging program, was designed to overcome these challenges. We present the methodology and first results of its second data release, which includes major improvements in reduction, calibration, and analysis, providing deeper photometry, improved astrometry, and high-precision proper motions across the Nuclear Stellar Disk. Observations were obtained with VLT/HAWK-I in two epochs separated by seven years, using speckle holography and a ground-layer adaptive optics system. Proper motions were derived both relative, by aligning epochs within the survey, and absolute, by tying to the Gaia reference frame. The new release achieves photometry about one magnitude deeper and astrometry about ten times more precise than the first release. Proper motions reach an accuracy of about 0.5 mas/yr relative to Gaia. In the Arches field, our clustering analysis recovers the cluster with mean velocities consistent with HST-based results. The second data release of the GALACTICNUCLEUS survey provides the most precise ground-based proper motion catalogs of the Galactic Center to date, enabling studies of the Nuclear Stellar Disk, young star kinematics, and new stellar cluster detections.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the properties of the first generation of galaxies is an ongoing challenge in observational astrophysics. While advances in deep field observation have led to the identification of large numbers of galaxies within the Epoch of Reionization, there are very few observed galaxies at this range that are sufficiently bright for high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. To this end, we analyse HST and ground-based photometry of five candidate strongly lensed galaxies, all projected behind the cores of massive clusters and with similarly red optical-NIR colors. All are characterized by a drop-off in their spectra between the near-infrared and optical wavelengths, corresponding to a Lyman-break that sets a lower bound on their redshifts. Using the open-source SED modeling software Prospector, we characterize two of these galaxies as high-z (z $\sim$ 6.5-7) while the other three are low-z (z $\sim$ 2) despite all five having similar apparent magnitudes at the observed wavelengths. We demonstrate that for the brightest dropout candidates we can distinguish high-z galaxies from red or dusty low-z galaxies using limited photometric data. The bright sources enable deep constraints on the dropout color which, in combination with flat continua measured in redder bands, require high-z solutions when searching the parameter space. At the time of writing this work significantly increases the number of m_AB < 24 galaxies at or above a redshift of 6, and provides a path forward for future analysis on the early era of galaxy formation

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers play an important role in many aspects of galaxy evolution, therefore, more accurate merger identifications are paramount for achieving a complete understanding of galaxy evolution. As we enter the era of very large imaging surveys, we are able to observe mergers extending to even lower masses and higher redshifts. Despite low-mass galaxies being more common, many previous merger identification methods were mostly calibrated for high-mass, local galaxies, which are easier to identify. To prepare for upcoming surveys, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using mock $\textit{HST}$ CANDELS images at $z \sim 1$ created from the IllustrisTNG50 cosmological simulation. We successfully identify galaxy mergers between a wide range of galaxies ($10^8M_\odot < M_\star < 10^{12.5}M_\odot$, and $\mu >1:10$), achieving overall accuracy, purity, and completeness of $\sim73\%$. We show, for the first time, that a CNN trained on this diverse set of galaxies is capable of identifying both major and minor mergers, early and late stage mergers, as well as nonmerging galaxies, similar to that of networks trained at lower redshifts and/or higher masses (with accuracies ranging between $66-80\%$) for the first time. We discuss the inherent limits of galaxy merger identification due to orientation angle and explore the confounding variables, such as star formation, to consider when applying to real data. This network enables the exploration of the impact of previously overlooked mergers of high mass ratio and low stellar masses on galaxy evolution in CANDELS, and can be expanded to surveys from $\textit{JWST}$, Rubin, $\textit{Roman}$, and $\textit{Euclid}$.
#### A census of quiescent galaxies across $0.5 < z < 8$ with JWST/MIRI: Mass-dependent number density evolution of quiescent galaxies in the early Universe

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations reveal numerous quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift ($z \sim 4-8$), challenging models of early galaxy formation and quenching. Accurate number density estimates are crucial for comparison with theory but remain uncertain. We systematically study QGs at $0.5 < z < 8$ using a mass-complete sample from the JWST/PRIMER survey with deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging. The MIRI data, probing rest-frame near-infrared at $z \sim 3-8$, are vital for robust stellar mass measurement and QG identification. We find that nearly all photometrically selected, point-like QG candidates located in the UVJ QG region are actually "Little Red Dots", for which the UVJ colors were wrongly estimated due to inaccurate photometric redshift estimation. MIRI reduces significantly contamination to high-mass QGs from star-forming galaxies, yielding lower number densities than previous studies. The evolution of QG number density is strongly mass-dependent. The density of high-mass QGs ($\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) > 10.3$) decreases rapidly from $n = 1\times10^{-5}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z=3-4$ to $n=2\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z = 4-5$, becoming negligible ($n \lesssim 10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ ) at $z > 5$. Conversely, low-mass QGs ($9<\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})<10.3$) maintain a nearly constant number density ($n\sim3\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$) across $z = 4-8$. This suggests low-mass QGs at $z > 4$ are likely temporarily quenched, akin to mini-quenched galaxies. Comparison with major hydrodynamical and semi-analytical models shows most underestimate high-mass QG densities at $z>4$ and fail to reproduce the constant low-mass QG density at $z>5$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stability of Milky Way analogs (MWAs) in the \texttt{TNG50} simulation against the growth of local axisymmetric instabilities, tracing their evolution from cosmic noon ($z=2.5$) to the present day ($z=0$). Using a two-component stability criterion that accounts for stars, gas, and the force field of the dark matter halo, we compute the net stability parameter ($Q_{T}$), the critical gas surface density ($\Sigma_{c}$), and the instability timescale ($\tau$) for 10 barred and 10 unbarred MWAs. We find that these galaxies remain stable to axisymmetric instabilities at all epochs, with $Q_{T}^{\min}>2$. The stability levels increase toward higher redshift, where enhanced gas velocity dispersion counterbalances the destabilizing effect of larger gas fractions. Further, the barred MWAs consistently show lower $Q_{T}^{\min}$ than unbarred ones. The gas density remains subcritical ($\Sigma_{g}<\Sigma_{c}$) across radii and epochs, implying that local axisymmetric instabilities are not the primary channel for star formation. Growth timescales are short (a few Myr) in central regions but increase exponentially to several Gyr in the outer disc, naturally explaining the concentration of star formation toward galactic centers. We study the effect of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM and find that while MWAs are stable against axisymmetric instabilities $(Q_{T}>1)$, a combination of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM can destabilize the disc at small scales even when $Q_{T}>1$.
#### Association of cold gas, massive galaxies, and AGNs in a filamentary protocluster traced by triple narrow-band imaging

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate galaxy populations in the HS1700+64 protocluster at $z=2.30$, characterized by two prominent linear filaments traced by spatially extended Ly$\alpha$ blobs. We conducted a wide area mapping of emission line galaxies across the protocluster using the unique combination of three matched narrow-band filters, corresponding to Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and [OIII] emission lines at $z=2.30$. We find that H$\alpha$ emitters are strongly clustered at the intersection of the filaments, suggesting a protocluster core. In contrast, Ly$\alpha$ emitters tend to avoid the dense region and the filaments, likely due to the resonant scattering of Ly$\alpha$ photons by HII gas and/or enhanced dust attenuation in galaxies associated with these structures. These findings support a scenario in which cold gas flows via filaments and to the core, fed by the cold-stream mode accretion in the early phase of protocluster assembly, and promoting active star formation there. Further evidence of the scenario comes from the alignment of massive, evolved galaxies in those filaments traced by distant red galaxies, suggesting accelerated galaxy growth in the filaments in the early Universe. This study clearly shows observationally that accelerated galaxy formation takes place not only in the protocluster core but also in the associated surrounding filamentary structure. This underscores the critical role of large-scale filaments in efficiently accumulating the cold gas and channeling it to galaxies therein and to the protocluster core. Such vigorous gas assembly facilitates star formation activity and drives galaxy growth in the early stage of cluster formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological models where dark matter interacts with dark energy via a pure momentum transfer and with no energy exchange (i.e. elastic) provide compelling scenarios for addressing the apparent lack of structures at low redshift. In particular, it has been shown that measurements of $S_8$ may show a statistically significant preference for the presence of elastic interactions. In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is not sufficiently strong as to disrupt virialised structures.
#### Mass dependence of halo baryon fractions from the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12553

 - **Abstract**
 We detect the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich imprint of peculiar motions of galaxy groups and clusters, using the photometric DESI Legacy Survey together with cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We develop a comprehensive forward model based on the AbacusSummit cosmological simulations: mock galaxy group catalogues and synthetic kSZ maps are generated, together with a reconstructed peculiar velocity field that allows for photo-$z$ errors, redshift-space distortions, and survey masks. We investigate possible contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB), finding that CIB effects are subdominant to the kSZ signal in the relevant ACT frequency channel. We then predict the kSZ signal expected when stacking CMB temperature maps around groups, taking account of their estimated radial velocity. Comparing the model with observations, we are able to constrain the total baryon fraction within haloes, as well as their internal gas profiles. We find evidence for mass dependence of the halo baryon fraction within the virial this http URL gas fraction in massive groups is consistent with the universal baryon fraction, but low-mass groups ($10^{12.5} \lesssim M\,/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim 10^{14}$) are depleted to $0.21 \pm 0.06$ times the universal baryon fraction. We find this low virial baryon fraction to be consistent with an extended gas profile, for which the total baryon content reaches the universal value well beyond the virial radius. This conclusion is consistent with previous analyses using X-ray, kSZ, and weak lensing, and plausibly reflects energetic feedback processes from the galaxies in these haloes.
#### JWST and Keck Observations of the Off-Nuclear TDE AT 2024tvd: A Massive Nuclear Star Cluster and Minor-Merger Origin for its Black Hole

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of the first optically selected off-nuclear tidal disruption event (TDE), AT 2024tvd, along with Keck/KCWI integral field unit spectroscopy. The spectra show broad H and He emission lines that are characteristic of a TDE. Stellar kinematics show smooth host-galaxy morphology and ordered bulge rotation, with no evidence of disturbances in velocity, dispersion, age or metallicity space. We construct the first quasi-simultaneous spectral-energy distribution (SED) from X-rays to infrared for a TDE and decompose it into three components: the TDE accretion flow, an unresolved nuclear star cluster (NSC), and heated dust emission. The accretion component implies a black hole mass of $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot) = 5.50\pm 0.04$, an instantaneous super-Eddington accretion rate of $\log (\dot{M}/M_{\odot} yr^{-1}) = -1.22 \pm 0.04$, and an outer disk photosphere radius of $\log(r_{out}/r_{g}) = 3.8 \pm 0.1$. The dust emission is well described by a blackbody with $T_{dust} = 873\pm 15$ K and peak luminosity $\log (L_{dust}/erg$ $s^{-1}) = 40.80\pm 0.01$, consistent with a dust echo near the sublimation radius. The SED is best fit when including additional stellar emission above the galaxy background at the TDE location, corresponding to $\log(M_{\star}/M_\odot) = 7.97^{+0.16}_{-0.26}$, which we interpret as a massive NSC or an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy. These results support a minor-merger origin for the MBH responsible for the TDE over scenarios involving gravitational recoil or dynamical ejection from the nucleus.
#### A constant upper luminosity limit of cool supergiant stars down to the extremely low metallicity of I Zw 18

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar wind mass loss is often assumed to depend on their metallicity $Z$. Therefore, evolutionary models of massive stars at lower $Z$ are able to retain more of their H-rich layers and evolve into brighter cool supergiants (cool SGs; $T_\mathrm{eff} < 7$ kK). Surprisingly, in galaxies in the range $0.2 \lesssim Z / Z_\odot \lesssim 1.5$ previous studies did not find a $Z$-dependence of the upper luminosity limit $L_\mathrm{max}$ of cool SGs. Here, we study four extra galaxies with HST and JWST. Observations of the extremely low-$Z$ dwarf galaxy I Zw 18 from JWST allow us to go down to $Z / Z_\odot \approx 1/40$. For cool SGs in all studied galaxies including I Zw 18, we find a constant $L_\mathrm{max} \approx 10^{5.6}$L$_\odot$, similar to literature results for $0.2 \lesssim Z / Z_\odot \lesssim 1.5$. In I Zw 18 and the other studied galaxies, the presence of Wolf-Rayet stars has been claimed. Although we cannot rule out that some of them become intermediate-temperature objects, this paints a picture in which evolved stars with $L>10^{5.6}$L$_\odot$ burn He as hot He-rich stars down to extremely low $Z$. We argue that $Z$-independent late-phase mass loss would be the most likely mechanism responsible. Regardless of the exact stripping mechanism, for the Early Universe our results imply a limitation on black hole masses and a contribution of stars born with $M\gtrsim 30$M$_\odot$ to its surprisingly strong nitrogen enrichment. We propose a scenario in which single stars at low $Z$ emit sufficiently hard ionizing radiation to produce lines of He II and C IV. In this scenario, late-phase $Z$-independent mass loss produces hot He-rich stars. Due to the well-understood $Z$-dependence of radiation-driven winds of hot stars, a window of opportunity would open below 0.2Z$_\odot$, where self-stripped He-rich stars can exist without dense WR winds that absorb hard ionizing radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent direct observations of atypically shaped rubble-pile satellites of sub-km asteroids in form of the spherically oblate Dimorphos and bilobate Selam challenge classical binary asteroid formation theories, which only explain the predominantly elongated population. This study further explores a rubble-pile satellite formation scenario for binary asteroid systems involving debris disks by investigating how mergers between moonlets with impact velocities below the mutual escape speed (sub-escape-velocity mergers) and tidal disruptions can create atypically shaped moons. We simulated sub-escape-velocity mergers between moonlets and studied the resulting structural evolution of the formed moon in a tidal environment using the polyhedral discrete elements method N-body code GRAINS. Firstly, we find that the shapes of rubble-pile moons formed by mergers in this regime are highly dependent on the shape and initial orientation of the involved moonlets. This can be explained by the moonlets largely retaining their individual structures during the impact. Secondly, we observe that mass-loss via tidal disruption for a bilobate object occurs in discrete regimes of distance to the primary. Closer to the primary, the innermost lobe is completely stripped off, while only a small piece of it is lost further out. Due to moonlets largely retaining their shape after undergoing a sub-escape-velocity merger, it is necessary to account for their non-sphericity to accurately model satellite formation in circumasteroidal debris disks. Moreover, the reshaping of merged objects via tidal disruption and distortion can produce oblate spheroid moons such as Dimorphos and highly elongated bilobate satellites with distinct necks such as Selam.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers are transformative events that can cause gaseous inflows capable of triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous studies of AGN in simulations have mainly focused on major interactions (i.e. between approximately equal mass galaxies), which produce the strongest inflows and, therefore, would be the most likely to trigger AGN activity. However, minor interactions are far more common and may still enhance accretion onto supermassive black holes. We present an analysis of post-merger galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation with stellar mass ratios of $\mu>$1:100. We select post-mergers from the TNG50-1 simulation, from redshifts $0\leq z< 1$, with stellar masses greater than $10^{10}M_{\odot}$. We find an AGN excess in post-mergers with a stellar mass ratio as low as 1:40. The AGN excess is mass ratio and luminosity dependent, with 1.2-1.6 times more AGN found in post-mergers of 1:40$\leq \mu < $1:4 than in matched non-merger controls, and as many as 6 times more AGN found in major $\mu \geq$1:4 post-mergers. The AGN excess is long lived, between 500 Myr to 1 Gyr post-coalescence, across all of the mass ratio regimes. We demonstrate that the most luminous AGN in the simulation overwhelmingly occur in either post-mergers or pairs (with $\mu \geq $1:40). Finally, we demonstrate that mini mergers are likely to be overlooked in observational studies due to the weakness of features usually associated with recent merger activity, such as tidal streams and shells, making it challenging to completely account for merger-induced AGN activity even in deep galaxy surveys.
