#### Blue Monsters and Dusty Descendants: Reconciling UV and IR Emission from Galaxies from z=7, up to z= 14

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations reveal massive, UV-bright galaxies at $z > 10$ with little apparent dust attenuation, whereas ALMA detections at $z \simeq 7$ show similarly massive systems that are already dust-rich and IR-luminous. This raises a fundamental question: can a single physical model of star formation and dust production explain both populations across cosmic time? We address this using a minimal framework with only two free parameters--the instantaneous star formation efficiency ($\epsilon_\star$) and the dust yield per Type II supernova ($y_d$)--and predict the rest-frame UV and IR luminosity functions (LFs) from $z \simeq 14$ to 7. For a uniform ISM, we find a UV-IR tension at the bright end of the LFs at $z \ge 7$. The UV LF requires low dust yields ($y_d \lesssim 0.01\,M_\odot$), whereas the $z=7$ IR LF requires higher yields ($y_d \sim 0.1\,M_\odot$) unless the star formation efficiency is boosted above $\epsilon_\star \approx 5$-10%. We show that incorporating a porous, turbulent ISM largely resolves this tension: turbulence opens low-column-density sightlines that enhance the UV escape fraction while leaving the total absorbed energy--and thus the IR luminosity--nearly unchanged once radiative-transfer--induced flattening of the attenuation curve is included. Large-grain dust distributions, while reducing UV opacity, play a secondary role once ISM porosity and radiative transfer are taken into account. At $z > 10$, however, even strong turbulence cannot reproduce the bright end of the UV LF at high dust yield. This could be resolved either by efficient dust removal in early massive systems or by substantial ISM dust growth by $z \simeq 7$. Our results highlight dust physics as a key lever for interpreting the rapidly growing UV and IR constraints within the broader context of early galaxy formation.
#### Massive Black Hole formation in proto-stellar clusters via early gas accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We review our semi-analytic model of stellar black hole (BH) mass growth by gas accretion in gas-rich stellar clusters during their birthstage within the first $\sim 10\,{\rm Myr}$ after the first stellar formation event. Such proto-stellar clusters are massive and compact, with typical masses $\sim 10^6\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and sizes $\sim 1\,{\rm pc}$, suggested by recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. We find that the BH masses are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the BH mass gap, well within the range of components of the recent gravitational-wave (GW) signal GW231123, and up to masses $\sim 10^3\,{\rm M}_\odot$.
#### Evidence for Log-Periodic Modulation in High-Redshift Compact Object Abundance Consistent with Cyclic Condensate Collapse

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19044

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.19044

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the redshift distribution of high-$z$ galaxies and active galactic nuclei identified in early JWST data, and investigate the presence of periodic structure in the variable $x=\ln(1+z)$. A baseline-corrected unbinned frequency analysis reveals a statistically significant peak corresponding to a spacing $\Delta x \simeq 0.34$, suggesting an approximately log-periodic pattern in the redshift distribution. A periodic structure in $x$ implies a preferred scaling ratio in $(1+z)$, which may be interpreted as a realization of discrete scale invariance. We discuss the possibility that such behavior arises from cyclic condensate dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) cosmology. In the Fukuyama--Morikawa--Tatekawa framework, repeated collapse and re-formation episodes of a self-interacting condensate occur over characteristic timescales of order several $10^8$ years. When mapped into redshift space, this temporal periodicity naturally translates into an approximately constant spacing in $\ln(1+z)$. While the observed frequency is not interpreted as a sharp theoretical prediction, its magnitude is quantitatively consistent with the intrinsic cycle timescale of QCD-axion motivated condensate dynamics. The present analysis therefore provides observational support for cyclic BEC cosmology as a viable dynamical origin of log-periodic structure in the high-redshift universe.
#### The major merger-active galactic nucleus connection up to the cosmic noon

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy major mergers are a potential mechanism for triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, but their role remains debated, particularly beyond the local Universe. We aim to shed light on the merger-AGN connection at $z=0.5$-$2$, exploiting the multi-wavelength datasets and {\it James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) observations in the COSMOS field. We construct a stellar mass-limited sample and identify AGN via mid-infrared (MIR) colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. We train convolutional neural networks to identify mergers with mock JWST observations. We create non-AGN and non-merger control samples matching the redshift, stellar mass, and star-formation rate distributions of the AGN and mergers. We find AGN to be moderately more frequent in mergers than in non-mergers, with excess ratios ranging from $\sim2.5$ (X-ray AGN) to $\sim1.3$ (MIR) and $\sim 1.1$-1.2 (SED AGN). Similarly, AGN galaxies show a higher merger fraction ($f_{merg}$) than non-AGN controls. We then study $f_{merg}$ as a function of relative and absolute AGN power, utilising the AGN fraction ($f_{AGN}$) and accretion disc luminosity (L$_{disc}$) parameters. We uncover a $f_{merg}$-$f_{AGN}$ relation with two regimes: $f_{merg}$ stays roughly flat for less-dominant AGN ($f_{AGN}<0.8$) but increases at $f_{AGN}>0.8$ for the MIR and X-ray AGN, and more gently for SED AGN, where mergers appear to be the main triggering mechanism. Additionally, $f_{merg}$ increases monotonically as a function of L$_{disc}$, for all AGN types, reaching $f_{merg}>50\%$ for the most luminous AGN (L$_{disc} \gtrsim 10^{46}\,{erg\,s^{-1}}$). Overall, our results suggest that major mergers can trigger AGN out to the cosmic noon at $z\sim2$. Furthermore, the role of major mergers shows a clear dependence on AGN luminosity and remains the principal mechanism for fuelling the most powerful AGN.
