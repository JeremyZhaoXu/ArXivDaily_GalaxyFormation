 - **Abstract**
 We present predictions for proper motions, infall times and times of first pericentric passage for 39 of M31's satellite galaxies. We estimate these by sampling satellite orbits from cosmological N-body simulations matched on mass, distance and velocity along the line of sight, in addition to properties of the host system. Our predictions are probabilistic based on repeated sampling from the uncertainty distributions of all quantities involved. We use these constraints on the satellites' orbital histories in conjunction with their published star formation histories to investigate the dominant environmental mechanisms for quenching satellites of M31-like hosts. Around half of the satellites appear to have quenched before their first pericentric passage around M31. Only the most massive satellites (with stellar masses > 10^8 M_sun) are able to maintain star formation for up to billions of years after infall. The majority of faint satellites, with stellar masses < 10^8 M_sun , were likely quenched before entering the M31 system. We compare our results for M31 against predictions for the Milky Way's satellites from the literature; M31's has a more active recent accretion history with more recently quenched satellites than the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate if systems of multiple Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) can serve as a proxy for dark matter halo mass, assess how their radiative properties relate to the underlying halo conditions, and explore the physics of star formation activity in LAEs and its relation to possible physically related companions. We use data from the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, which targets LAEs in three narrow redshift slices. We identify physically associated LAE multiples in the COSMOS field at $z = 2.4$, $z = 3.1$, and $z=4.5$, and use a mock catalog from the IllustrisTNG100 simulation to assess the completeness and contamination affecting the resulting sample of LAE multiples. We then study their statistical and radiative properties as a function of multiplicity, where we adopt the term multiplicity to refer to the number of physically associated LAEs. We find a strong correlation between LAE multiplicity and host halo mass in the mocks, with higher multiplicity systems preferentially occupying more massive halos. In both ODIN and the mock sample, we find indications that the mean Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and UV magnitude of LAEs in multiples increase with multiplicity. The halo-wide LAE surface brightness densities in Ly$\alpha$ and UV increase with multiplicity, reflecting more compact and actively star-forming environments. The close agreement between the model and ODIN observations supports the validity of the Ly$\alpha$ emission model in capturing key physical processes in LAE environments. Finally, a subhalo-based perturbation induced star formation model reproduces the minimum subhalo mass distribution in simulations at $z=2.4$, suggesting that local perturbations, rather than the presence of LAE companions, drive star formation in these systems. For the higher redshifts, neighbor perturbations do not seem to be the main driver that triggers star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of stellar populations in three galaxies at the centers of cooling flow clusters. All three host rich molecular gas reservoirs and show prominent Balmer absorption from $30-100$ Myr-old stars consistent with long lasting star formation. Two systems, A1835 and PKS 0745-191, have extended young stellar populations in their centers with recent star formation rates of 100 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 8 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. In A1835 we uncover a massive blueshifted clump of young stars moving at high speed with respect to the gas and central galaxy. We suggest this feature is a young population that formed in a gaseous outflow that has detached from its natal gas and is falling back toward the galaxy. This result, combined with a companion study (arXiv:2404.02212) tracing nebular emission which presumably cooled from the hot X-ray atmosphere, indicates that star formation is proceeding in a dynamically complex environment resulting from the central galaxy's motion with respect to the cooling clouds and motion induced by feedback from the central radio jets. In RX J0820.9+0752 intermediate age stars are found in a filament outside of the nucleus with no discernible star formation at the center of the galaxy. All projected galaxies are composed of old stellar populations with deep D4000 breaks and are devoid of detectable warm gas. While in some instances they may be interacting gravitationally with the central galaxy, they cannot have donated the upward of $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas found in these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way (MW) is expected to exhibit a large-scale dynamical response to the recent infall of the LMC. This event produces a dynamical friction wake and shifts the MW's halo density center. The structure of this response encodes information about the LMC- MW mass ratio, the LMC's orbit, the MW halo's pre-infall structure and could provide constraints on dark matter physics. To extract this information, a method to separate these effects and recover the initial shape of the MW's halo is required. Here, we use basis function expansions to analyze the halo response in eighteen simulations of MW-LMC-like interactions from the MWest cosmological, dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations. The results show that mergers similar to the LMC consistently generate a significant dipole and a secondary quadrupole response in the halo. The dipole arises from the host density center displacement and halo distortions, and its amplitude scales as the square of the MW-LMC mass ratio, peaking 0.2-0.7 Gyr after the LMC's pericenter. The quadrupole's strength depends primarily on the original axis ratios of the host halo, though contributions from the dynamical friction wake cause it to peak less than 0.3 Gyr before pericenter. Future measurements of both the dipole and quadrupole imprints of the LMC's passage in the density of the MW's stellar halo should be able to disentangle these effects and provide insight into the initial structure of the MW's halo, the MW's response, and the mass of the LMC.

 - **Abstract**
 Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) were recognized as highly variable sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability traces to multiple phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature changes, foreground absorbers, and structural changes to the accretion disk. Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole variability are now being probed. We report the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted UV/optical energy to date is $\sim10^{54}$ erg, i.e., the complete conversion of approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy. We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass $(>30\, M_\odot)$ star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring one-point statistics in redshifted 21 cm intensity maps offers an opportunity to explore non-Gaussian features of the early universe. We assess the impact of instrumental effects on measurements made with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) by forward modeling observational and simulation data. Using HERA Phase I observations over 94 nights, we examine the second (m2, variance) and third (m3) moments of images. We employ the DAYENU-filtering method for foreground removal and reduce simulated foreground residuals to 10% of the 21 cm signal residuals. In noiseless cosmological simulations, the amplitudes of one-point statistics measurements are significantly reduced by the instrument response and further reduced by wedge-filtering. Analyses with wedge-filtered observational data, along with expected noise simulations, show that systematics alter the probability distribution of the map pixels. Likelihood analysis based on the observational data shows m2 measurements disfavor the cold reionization model characterized by inefficient X-ray heating, in line with other power spectra measurements. Small signals in m3 due to the instrument response of the Phase I observation and wedge-filtering make it challenging to use these non-Gaussian statistics to explore model parameters. Forecasts with the full HERA array predict high signal-to-noise ratios for m2, m3, and S3 assuming no foregrounds, but wedge-filtering drastically reduces these ratios. This work demonstrates conclusively that a comprehensive understanding of instrumental effects on m2 and m3 is essential for their use as a cosmological probe, given their dependence on the underlying model.

 - **Abstract**
 The LMC and SMC are interacting dwarf galaxies that offer a valuable testbed for studying the effects of galactic mergers. We investigate the chemodynamic history of the LMC in the context of its interaction with the SMC by inferring stellar birth radii, first validated on a hydrodynamical simulation tailored to reproduce their interaction history. Using inferred birth radii and stellar ages, we identify signatures of dynamical and chemical evolution across the LMC disk. We find that the LMC's metallicity gradient steepened around 5, 3, and 1 Gyr ago, coinciding with enhanced star formation (SF) episodes. These events exhibit distinct spatial patterns -- initially concentrated in the inner disk at 5 Gyr, expanding outward by 3 Gyr, and becoming widespread with renewed central activity at 1 Gyr -- likely reflecting changes in spin alignment between the interacting disks if the enhancements of SF tracks the pericenter passages of the SMC to the LMC. The inferred radial migration strength of the LMC shows notable enhancements at 0.5, 2, and 5 Gyr. The most $\alpha$-enriched stars form 2-3 Gyr ago at birth radii of 2-4 kpc, the only epoch when star formation is broadly distributed across the disk. Finally, unlike the Milky Way, the LMC lacks a clear [$\alpha$/M]-[Fe/H] bimodality. This is likely due to its more centrally concentrated star formation during these periods, compared to the MW's more extended outer-disk star formation enhancements. These findings place strong constraints on the LMC's assembly history and its interaction with the SMC.
#### The effect of mass and morphology on the mass assembly of galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The pace at which galaxies grew into their current stellar masses and how this growth is regulated is still not fully understood, nor is the role that morphology plays in this process. We applied full spectral fitting techniques with pyPipe3D to the MaNGA sample to obtain its star formation and stellar mass histories and used these to investigate the mass assembly of galaxies by measuring how their specific star formation correlates to their stellar mass at different look-back times. We find that the correlation between these two parameters was shallower in the past. Galaxies used to have similar mass doubling times and the current negative correlation between the specific star formation and M* is primarily due to more massive galaxies 'dropping' off the main sequence earlier than less massive ones. Additionally, selecting the galaxies into bins based on their present-day morphology shows a segregation in specific star formation rate (sSFR) that is maintained even at high look-back times, showing that the factors that determine which morphology a galaxy ends up in are in place at very early times. Similarly, selecting them based on their current star formation status shows that, on average, currently retired galaxies used to have slightly a higher sSFR before the drop-off, whereas galaxies that have continued to form stars until today had a lower sSFR initially. We compare our results to a set of cosmic surveys, finding partial agreement in our results with several of them, though with significant offsets in redshift. Finally, we discuss how our results fit with certain theoretical models on galaxy evolution as well as cosmological simulations.
