 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy simulations have come a long way from the early days of simple N-body calculations, which considered only gravitational interactions, to the complex, multi-physics models used today. Beginning with initial conditions representative of the Universe shortly after the Big Bang, these modern simulations integrate the relevant physical processes involved in galaxy formation, such as gravity, gas dynamics, cooling, star formation, and feedback, while accounting for cosmic expansion and structure formation. This review provides an introductory overview of cosmological galaxy simulations, outlining the essential components and methods used to model the formation and evolution of galaxies on the computer. It also discusses common steps in the post-processing analysis, essential for extracting physical insights from these numerical experiments, along with basic tests to assess simulation validity and accuracy. Looking forward, next-generation simulations aim to push resolution boundaries, incorporate additional physical processes, and improve the robustness of the numerical models, promising to lead to a deeper understanding of how galaxies emerged and evolved over cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been demonstrated that one can track down galaxies in absorption 'hidden' in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest through the use of 'strong, blended Lyman-$\alpha$' (or SBLA) absorption. Specifically a series of publications studied SBLA absorption systems with Lyman-$\alpha$ flux transmission, $F_{Ly \alpha} < 0.25$ on scales of 138 km s$^{-1}$ in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In order to better understand the connection between halos and these SBLAs, we make use of several million synthetic absorption spectra from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, at z=2 and z=3. We explore spectra with SDSS-like resolution in order to understand the nature of SBLAs as defined thus far, as well as with high resolution (or 'resolved') spectra to generalise and optimise SBLAs as halo finders. For the SDSS SBLAs, we find that up to 78% of these absorption systems reside in hlaos, where the stronger the absorption and the lower the redshift, the higher the probability. We also manage to recover a mean halo mass of $10^{12.25} M_{\odot}$, in line with what is measured in observations. For the resolved SBLAs, we expand on the previous definition and allow the SBLA spectra size to vary between 54 km s$^{-1}$ and 483 km s$^{-1}$. We find that the largest absorbers have the highest probability of finding halos. When applying a hierarchical framework, where we allow the largest SBLAs to consume the smaller ones, we find that the halo mass distributions for each SBLA spectral size becomes narrower with respect to the non-hierarchical case. We are also able to probe halo masses from $M_h \approx 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$ (for 100 km s$^{-1}$ SBLAs) to $M_h \approx 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$ (for 450 km s$^{-1}$ SBLAs). With these results, we show that we are able to transform the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest into a powerful halo finding machine for not only identifying CGM regions, but also estimating their host halo masses.
#### Bridging Literature and the Universe Via A Multi-Agent Large Language Model System

 - **Abstract**
 As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful, internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate scientific research for physicists.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08998

 - **Abstract**
 We present ongoing radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018hyz, which was first detected in the radio at 972 days after disruption, following multiple non-detections from earlier searches. The new observations presented here span approximately 1370-2160 days and 0.88-240 GHz. We find that the light curves continue to rise at all frequencies during this time period, following a power law of about F ~ t^3 (compared to F_nu ~ t^5.7 at 972-1400 days), and reaching a peak luminosity of L~ 10^40 erg/s, comparable to the luminosity of the relativistic TDE Swift 1644+57 on the same timescale. The multi-frequency data indicate that the peak frequency does not significantly evolve over the 1030-day span of our observations, while the peak flux density increases by an order of magnitude. The observed behavior is consistent with two possible scenarios: (i) a delayed spherical outflow launched about 620 days post-disruption with a velocity of ~0.3c and an energy of ~10^50 erg, and (ii) a highly off-axis (~80-90 deg) relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of Gamma ~8 and E_K ~ 10^52 erg. Continued radio observations to capture the light curve peak, as well as VLBI observations, could distinguish between these scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing (WL) peak statistics capture cosmic non-linear structures and can provide additional cosmological information complementary to cosmic shear two-point correlation analyses. They have been applied to different WL surveys successfully. To further facilitate their high precision applications, it is very timely to investigate the impacts of different systematics on WL peak statistics and how to mitigate them. Concerning the influence from galaxy intrinsic alignments (IAs), in this paper, we develop a theoretical model for WL high peaks taking into account the IA effects. It is an extension of our previous halo-based model. The IA corrections mainly include the modification of the lensing profile of clusters of galaxies due to the alignments of satellite galaxies and the additional shape noise correlations. We validate our model using simulations with the semi-analytical galaxy formation. We consider the cases where the satellite galaxies are averagely radially aligned toward the centers of their host clusters but with different dispersions $\sigma_{\theta}$. We show that our model works well for $\sigma_{\theta}>45^{\circ}$. If the IA corrections are not included in the model, for the Euclid/CSST-like source galaxy distribution and the survey area of $\sim 1000 deg^2$, the IA induced bias on $S_8$ can reach $\sim 8\sigma$ even for $\sigma_{\theta}=75^{\circ}$. With our model, not only the bias can be well mitigated, but also we can constrain the satellite IA to the level of {\bf $\sigma(\sigma_{\theta})\sim \pm 24^{\circ}$} simultaneously from WL high peak analyses alone using data from such a survey.
#### How homogeneous was the chemical enrichment of the Milky Way 13 gigayears ago?

 - **Abstract**
 We reanalyze the chemical composition of the metal-poorest tail of the Galactic halo using highly accurate atmospheric parameters Giribaldi et al. (2021, 2023) and cutting-edge 3D NLTE models Amarsi et al (2018). Most [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] diagrams in the literature exhibit significant scatter at [Fe/H] $\lesssim -2$ dex, often interpreted as evidence of inhomogeneous enrichment during the early phases of galaxy evolution Rossi et al. (2021). However, our analysis of observational data reveals that in the range $-3.5 <$ [Fe/H] $< -2$ dex, the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] distribution is relatively narrow. This finding suggests a low degree of stochastic enrichment in magnesium during these epochs in the Milky Way halo.
#### Novel Challenges in Tracking Self-Interacting Dark Matter Subhalos

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological N-body simulations are among the primary tools for studying structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time. In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations. These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.
#### Fast and Accurate Stellar Mass Predictions from Broad-Band Magnitudes with a Simple Neural Network: Application to Simulated Star-Forming Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 A simple, fully connected neural network with a single hidden layer is used to estimate stellar masses for star-forming galaxies. The model is trained on broad-band photometry - from far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths - generated by the Semi-Analytic Model of galaxy formation (SHARK), along with derived colour indices. It accurately reproduces the known SHARK stellar masses with respective root-mean-square and median errors of only 0.085 and 0.1 dex over the three decades in stellar mass. Analysis of the trained network's parameters reveals several colour indices to be particularly effective predictors of stellar mass. In particular, the FUV - NUV colour emerges as a strong determinant, suggesting that the network has implicitly learned to account for attenuation effects in the ultraviolet bands, thereby increasing the diagnostic power of this index. Traditional methods such as spectral energy distribution fitting, though widely used, are often complex, computationally expensive, and sensitive to model assumptions and parameter degeneracies. In contrast, the neural network relies solely on easily obtained observables, enabling rapid and accurate stellar mass predictions at minimal computational cost. The model derives its predictions exclusively from patterns learned in the data, without any built-in physical assumptions (such as stellar initial mass function). These results demonstrate the utility of this study's machine learning approach in astrophysical parameter estimation and highlight its potential to complement conventional techniques in upcoming large galaxy surveys.
#### Gaussian Process Methods for Very Large Astrometric Data Sets

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel non-parametric method for inferring smooth models of the mean velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor of the Milky Way from astrometric data. Our approach is based on Stochastic Variational Gaussian Process Regression (SVGPR) and provides an attractive alternative to binning procedures. SVGPR is an approximation to standard GPR, the latter of which suffers severe computational scaling with N and assumes independently distributed Gaussian Noise. In the Galaxy however, velocity measurements exhibit scatter from both observational uncertainty and the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the distribution function. We exploit the factorization property of the objective function in SVGPR to simultaneously model both the mean velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor as separate Gaussian Processes. This achieves a computational complexity of O(M^3) versus GPR's O(N^3), where M << N is a subset of points chosen in a principled way to summarize the data. Applied to a sample of ~8 x 10^5 stars from the Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity Survey, we construct differentiable profiles of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion as functions of height above the Galactic midplane. We find asymmetric features in all three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion tensor, providing evidence that the vertical dynamics of the Milky Way are in a state of disequilibrium. Furthermore, our dispersion profiles exhibit correlated structures at several locations in |z|, which we interpret as signatures of the Gaia phase spiral. These results demonstrate that our method provides a promising direction for data-driven analyses of Galactic dynamics.
